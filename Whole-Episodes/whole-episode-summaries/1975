this episode departs from the usual columbo format in several ways first the man implied to be the killer is not and thus the episode becomes a true whodunit with the actual murderer revealed at the end of the episode second neither murder is shown third columbos personality is atypically agitated impatient and less amiable than in other episodes fourth regular cliches such as just one more thing and somethings been botherin me are absent from this episode fifth rather than working alone columbo works closely alongside two other police officers who travel with him in his investigations and at times interrogate suspects finally the episode departs from the usual style in presenting a far greater emphasis on comedy including some minor slapstick elements and features a far more light-hearted and less dramatic tone

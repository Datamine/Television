leonard is so infatuated with penny that after letting her use their shower he agrees to retrieve her tv from her ex-boyfriend kurt brian wade however kurts physical superiority overpowers leonard and sheldons combined iq of 360 and they return with a walk of shame empty handed and without pants feeling bad for them penny offers to take the guys to dinner in what is the start of a new friendship between them 
 
when sheldon and leonard go over to pennys apartment to drop off a box of flat pack furniture that came for her sheldon is deeply disturbed when he sees how messy and disorganized her apartment appears later that night while penny sleeps sheldon who is extremely obsessive-compulsive and cannot sleep because of the fact sneaks into her apartment to clean and organize it leonard catches him and reluctantly helps him clean 
the next morning penny realizes that they had been in her apartment and becomes furious sheldon tries apologizing to penny but fails after remarking that leonard is a gentle and thorough lover later penny encounters raj in the hallway and talks to him finally reasoning with herself that the guys were just trying to help her though raj does not utter a word as he is not able to speak to women unless drunk due to his selective mutism leonard then apologizes prompting penny to hug him and forgive him 
 
when leonard sees penny kissing a man in front of her apartment door he is devastated thinking she has rejected him the guys convince him to ask someone out at work so he asks out fellow scientist leslie winkle sara gilbert who preemptively turns him down as leonard slips deeper into his depression which involves thinking about buying a cat sheldon points out that he was not actually rejected by penny as he had not asked her out leonard agrees and promptly asks penny out to dinner but she mistakes his invite as an invitation to hang with all the guys despite being aware of this leonard keeps the date and makes up excuses as to why the guys were absent 
on the date penny mentions the man leonard saw was not her boyfriend but that she has a habit of having weekend-long casual sex encounters to get over relationships excited leonard begins to become more confident but he accidentally hurts himself and penny has to take him home in the end leonard does not get the courage to reveal his true feelings to penny even though she suspected what he was up to 
 
sheldon is fired from his job as a physicist at the university when he insults his new boss dr eric gablehauser mark harelik his change of circumstance sends him into a downward spiral of depression which results in working on developing luminous fish for nightlights and buying a loom for himself leonard tries to cure him by sending for sheldons mom mary cooper laurie metcalf 
when she arrives for a visit the men realize she is completely the opposite of what they expected she is sweet and down-to-earth if culturally ignorant and a devout christian a really good and loving and caring mother which they have not expected after waiting it out mary finally forces sheldon to apologize and he is given his job back after she flirts with dr gablehauser as mary is a widow sheldon asks if dr gablehauser will be his new daddy and his mother replies well see 
 
while eating at the cheesecake factory where penny works the guys run into leslie winkle sara gilbert and she suggests that leonard play in her string quartet as they are in need of a new cellist as the other players are uncomfortable near the other guy due to the chance he was irradiated at work later after the practice in leonard and sheldons apartment leslie offers herself to leonard and they have sex 
meanwhile sheldon is uneasy as to how to act after realizing leslie slept with leonard later on penny congratulates leonard and he tries to figure out what pennys words meant leonard eventually decides to pursue a real relationship with leslie over an imaginary one with penny however when leonard arrives in the lab leslie makes it clear she is not interested in a relationship and only used him to satisfy her sex drive realizing she used him for a one-night stand leonard later tells penny who walks away with a smile on her face seemingly happy to hear this news 
 
the guys are invited to pennys halloween party first turning it down as they do not dance but changing their mind when costumes are mentioned at the party the guys have problems socializing for example sheldon is unable to explain his costume as the doppler effect since none of pennys friends are physicist or smart enough to understand his explanation raj cannot speak to women and howard is mistaken for peter pan instead of robin hood and leonard is insecure later pennys ex-boyfriend kurt brian wade shows up and confronts leonard causing him to leave 
later that night penny goes to check on him and apologizes while also very upset about kurt leonard tells her that she is perfect and she kisses him leonard asks her how much she has had to drink she claims a lot and that he was smart for figuring that out leonard sarcastically admits yea im a fricking genius for stopping pennys advances she goes back to the party kissing him again in front of kurt prompting leonard to say thats how we roll at the shire before locking the doors in panic meanwhile howard cannot find raj who ends up going home and has sex with a woman he had met at the party who found him to be a good listener

sheldon is distraught over the odd number in the group believing they can no longer function he is even more distraught when he invites penny again to play halo but she declines the offer to go dancing believing that they are falling apart as a group the guys go to speak to howard when they arrive they hear christy and howards mother arguing loudly causing christy to leave howard once again single goes with the guys to play halo and the group is restored yet again 
 
raj introduces his parents dr vm koothrappali and mrs koothrappali brian george and alice amter via webcam to his friends however raj immediately becomes overwhelmed after his parents try to arrange a date with lalita gupta sarayu rao a childhood friend and dental student as he cannot talk to women howard pretends to be raj and sets up the date with lalita meanwhile penny takes up bar tending for some extra money as she practices mixing drinks with the guys they discover that after drinking an alcoholic beverage raj can actually talk to women they decide the date should be at pennys restaurant so she and the guys can keep an eye on rajs behavior while drinking 
however on his date raj becomes a very obnoxious drunk and lalita ends up leaving with sheldon who compliments her by comparing her to princess panchali a princess in an indian fairy tale and she is very impressed with sheldon back from the restaurant raj tries to explain to his parents what happened even though he is already upset things become worse when his parents find out he was drinking leonard asks sheldon if he is going to see lalita again and he replies that he already has a dentist 
 
cleaning up after an internet experiment leonard discovers a letter in the trash can he and sheldon had been invited to present some research they had done together at an academic conference however sheldon disapproves of presenting research in person and says leonard cannot go without him leonard defies him and says he will go and present the findings on his own this causes a rift between the two which penny tries to mend but accidentally makes the things even worse at the conference sheldon appears tries to discredit leonards presentation tries to blow up leonards head with his mind à la the movie scanners and has a physical altercation with leonard in the end the fight is captured by howard and put on youtube but also causes a conflict with penny since he took a picture with her and posted to facebook 
 
penny is given a part in rent though after leonard and sheldon hear her sing extremely off-key with even sheldon saying that if cats would hear it they would hate it too leonard lies to avoid seeing her performance so he will not hurt her feelings sheldon becomes worried that leonards lie was not good enough so he creates an intricate lie about his non-existent drug addicted cousin leopold houston who was in need of an intervention and thus why they could not see the play

recognizing the enormous and uncontrollable white object as fellow exorcist and good friend suman dark a horrified lenalee wonders how he became a togaochi fallen one the legions of akuma continue to assault the huge suman but fail allen and lenalee desperately try to discover how to stop sumans innocence from insanity and try to save him while they tried to pulled suman out a girl is in the hole which suman is in allen pulls her out which leads him into the hole while allen is inside he discovered the truth suman had made a deal with tyki allen realised that sumans innocence is slowly killing suman because of his betrayal  
the fallen one continues to destroy the nearby town allen attempts to stop suman from destroying a nearby village by increasing his innocences synchro rate to its maximum power meanwhile lenalee learns the truth of a fallen and sumans fate from komui that he could not be saved and that he will die she also learned that suman had betrayed the order and god back to allen his left arm stopped activating and broke causing him to have intense pain  
the attack of the akuma on the ship continues and suman continues to destroy the town the huge body of suman begins to deteriorate and allen wastes no time activating his innocence but unfortunately his arm begins to grow in intense pain as he tries to remove sumans innocence miraculously allen manages to get suman and his innocence out of the body then allen and suman fell to the ground unfortunately when allen wakes up he realizes that suman cannot move or respond his body is still alive but his mind is dead allen holds on to sumans innocence in his hand thankful still that hes at least alive when suddenly a slit opens from sumans head and strange black butterflies come flying out and a noah appears  
after watching suman crumble away in front of him allen meets the sadistic noah tyki mikk whose ability besides controlling the devilish butterflies known as tease is to pass through absolutely anything at will he rips off allens left arm and tears a hole in allens heart and destroys his innocence despite allens constant screaming to halt his actions knowing that he is near his final moments of life allen orders timcanpy to escape with sumans innocence timcanpy reluctantly does so as tyki draws closer to the innocence afterwards tyki with the help of his list keeper cell roron discovers allen is on his death list he then orders a tease to tear a hole through allens heart killing him slowly  
lavi and lenalee travel through the air with lavis hammer they saw timcanpy being attacked by akuma after saving timcanpy from the remaining akuma lavi and lenalee follow tim back to the bamboo forest but find that allen is not there anymore tim shows lavi and lenalee the memories of what happened there causing great distraught to both exorcists when they return to the port a man from the asian branch named wong explains that allen was found and is being held at their headquarters in so doing suggesting that allen is dead and that the exorcists are to continue their journey to japan without allen but arriving as his replacement is miranda lotto who uses her anti-akuma weapon time record to restore the ships damage thus the exorcists finally depart china meanwhile allenstill thinking hes deaddreams a lake lake that reflects the order in ruins with a black moon and red sky and lenalee crying alone with what appears to be allens corpse only to awaken in the asian branch alive  
allen finally opens his eyes and wonders how he is alive he discovers from asian headquarters chief bak chan that it is his own innocence which although was destroyed lingered on as a cloud of particles and actually filled the hole of his damaged heart saving his life determined to rejoin his companions get to edo and fulfill his promise to mana allen vows to restore his innocence at all costs however he discovers it will not be as easy as he thinks also allen meets wong who is baks assistant fou who is the guardian of the asian headquarters and three division workers rikei shifu and lou fa  
still unable to restore his innocence by himself allen begins his special training with fou doing battle with her while constantly trying to activate his innocence to fight meanwhile general cloudnyne and general winters zokalo return to the black order upon news of the deaths of their exorcist units  
back on the ship en route to edo lenalee finally decides to accept the fact that allen had to be left behind and she puts on her new exorcist uniform however the ship is attacked by eshii a powerful level 3 akuma who was once a japanese painter which explains why he uses the word title before every attack lavi and bookman fiercely fight against eshii but is no match for him resulting in bookman getting a serious injury only saved temporarily by mirandas power realizing that everyone is in serious danger lenalee leaves the ship to confront eshii alone  
lenalee and eshii continue to fight fiercely in the air while the ship comes under attack from akuma hiding up in the clouds many crewmen are struck by the blasts and killed only to be revived temporarily by mirandas innocence lavi tries to determine how they can fight an enemy that they cannot see meanwhile lenalee and eshiis battle reaches the ocean surface where eshii reveals its true ability he uses its dark matter to create chains around lenalee and the ship increasing the gravity around them and dragging them underwater lenalee struggles to stay afloat but eshii pushes her down and she disappears into the ocean depths  
lenalee floating in darkness remembers allen and what she said to him concerning her view of the world afterwards she pushes herself and her innocence to the limits and even exceeds them defeating eshii in the process and disappearing once again  
the sailors and exorcists on board the ship are trying to protect it from other akuma after finally defeating them they now wait for lenalees return anxiously but lavi could not wait and he uses his hammer to find lenalee suddenly a yellow akuma appears holding lenalee in a crystal-like shield  
lavi leaves the ship to search for lenalee he eventually finds her encased in her innocence which crystallized in order to protect her the innocence is in turn supported by chomesuke a level 2 akuma that was converted by cross marian with chomesukes help lavi brings lenalee back to the ship when the crystal melts she is unable to walk chomesuke delivers a warning from cross and explains the dire situation in japan nevertheless the group decides to push forward since they are pressed for time the exorcists along with three surviving sailors board a lifeboat that chomesuke propels miranda deactivates her innocence causing the ship and its crew to revert to real time with anita mahoja and the people on board disappear into the sea  
the five exorcists and three surviving sailors finally arrive in japan but they are in bad shape chomesuke whose real name is sachiko tells them that japan has long been under the earls control on the way to edo the group witnesses one of chomesukes friends being killed and eaten by three level 3 akuma chomesuke is captured by one of them who prove to be more than a match for both lavi and krory however lavi cleverly attracts the attention of the other two level 3s and the three akuma begin fighting amongst each other over who will kill the exorcists who seize their chance to escape  
allen trains endlessly trying to reactivate his innocence but he makes little progress frustrated he begins to try harder as he desperately wants to return to his friends and to fight the akuma alongside them fou disguises herself as lou fa and talks with allen reminding him that he fights not for the sake of fighting but for something precious to him allen remembers that he is fighting for the sake of his friends meanwhile tyki mikk checks with the earl to see if the cell roron is correct about allens existence he then sends a level 3 akuma and a tease to china to kill allen  
a level 3 akuma heads for china to kill allen lenalee and the others head towards edo and are ambushed by the level 3 akuma that they saw on the shore they manage to evade them for a while but eventually they are surrounded before they can do anything however the earl summons all akuma to edo so they leave without doing anything chomesuke also parts with the group because the earls order is too strong for her to resist but she manages to tell them that the earl is at the edo castle meanwhile while training with fou in the asian branch allens eye activates the earl orders the akuma to kill general cross and general tiedoll and dispatches the noah clan lavi and the exorcists appear and challenge them in order to protect the generals tyki mikk recognizes them and challenges lavi who knows him only as the noah that killed allen tyki tells them that allen is still alive but he had sent a level 3 akuma to kill him  
allen slowly improves his fighting technique but he still cannot cause his innocence to materialize though it does respond to the training allen focuses deeply on returning to his friends causing his innocence to show high energy readings however just as the energy readings peak allens left eye activates and searches for an unknown target which causes allen great pain and alarms the scientists allen describes a growing sense that an akuma is calling him and he tries to continue training despite the immense pain however at that point the pain spikes and allen faints as they take a break bak and the apprentices contemplate allens fate suddenly fou senses something strange as tyki mikks level 3 assassin approaches and she tells bak to hide allen the akuma blows a hole through fou breaking her barrier the branch alarm goes off and everyone panics allen having come to runs into the apprentices then comes face to face with the level 3 allens left eye immediately activates and omits a strange sensation fou tells allen to run as his life is the top priority but allen refuses at that moment the akuma attacks allen with its dark matter piercing through his chest  
tykis level 3 akuma assassin hits allen with its dark matter that partially breaks down his molecular structure making his body highly unstable meanwhile as the asian branch enters lockdown bak awakens the guardian deity with a blood seal on his hand trapping the akuma in a web of light the group then retreats with bak carrying a wounded fou and rikei carrying an unstable allen bak leads them to a large room which he attempts to seal with the guardian deity however before he can finish the akuma catches up with them fou decides to sacrifice herself in order to allow allen and the others get to safety she takes the form of allen and enters the passage to face the akuma as bak seals the section away allen who is deeply upset by fous sacrifice tries to force bak to unseal the doorway even threatening to expose baks secret stalking of lenalee when bak still refuses allen expresses his realization that he fights for the sake of both humans and akuma then black blood drips from his left eye instead of tears his innocence manifests itself around him and he warps to the door which bak finally unseals allen enters the room just as fou is about to be killed allen jumps onto the akumas back and injures it with his right hand  
allen engages the level 3 akuma in battle allen speaks to the soul trapped within the akuma and learns that this soul was the one that had previously been calling out to him the soul asks allen to save him and allen consents however because his bodys composition is unstable due to the akumas prior attack allen literally begins to fade during the fight when allen is almost atomized the akuma turns on bak and fou partially disintegrating their bodies too enraged allen finally decides that he will save humans with his right hand and akuma with his left hand this reactivates his innocence and he destroys the level 3 his new innocence gives him a long black arm with razor sharp talons for fingers he also acquires a white cowl that shoots web-like projectiles and is fitted with a mask before the akuma dies he tells allen of the gathering of the noah the level 3 akuma and the exorcists in edo  
after allen recovers his left arm he reflects on his old innocence while many tests are done on the ark and a few on his new innocence the tests show that his innocence has completely synchronized with his body bak and allen decide on a new name for allens newly evolved innocence gods clown also known as crown clown he is then given a new exorcist coat by wong and he bids farewell to the asian branch preparing to leave and board the ark bak gives allen a wireless communicator in a form of a gold earring which allows him to talk to komui lou fa rikei and shifu return allens deck of cards and allen prepares to head off to edo via noahs ark the episode ends with lavi preparing to engage in battle with tyki mikk  
the battle between the exorcists and the noah continues while lavi fights tyki the earl combines the level 3 akuma into one giant akuma and attacks the exorcists meanwhile lavi attacks tyki with a new move a combination of the fire and heaven seals the exorcists attack the combined akuma but their attacks have little effect the combined akuma uses its evil star gita attack and destroys much of the battlefield chomesuke sacrifices herself to enable lavi krory and bookman to attack the combined akumas head its weak point although they succeed in knocking it down the akuma manages to get back up again and severely injures them meanwhile allen enters the ark and is surprised to find that it is a lovely place filled with white buildings just like any other country when he expresses his concern for his friends komui cheers him up by telling him to think about happy thoughts kanda marie and general tiedoll arrive in edo overlooking the scene of the battle between the exorcists and the akuma  
the fight between lavi and tyki continues while lavi is repeatedly beaten down by tyki bookman and krory continue their assault on the combined akuma but their attacks continue to fail meanwhile miranda can no longer maintain her innocences barrier over the storage room giving tyki the opportunity to capture lenalee chaoji and his comrades attempt to help her but their efforts are in vain just as tyki is about to deal them the killing blow kanda intervenes and begins a fight with tyki with lavis help he manages to save lenalee tyki prepares to counterattack but he retreats when ordered to by the millennium earl marie uses his noel organons ability to paralyze one of the combined akuma kanda then reveals mugens second illusion nigentou and destroys the akuma in one slash however before the exorcists can relax the earl fires off a black orb of energy that grows larger and larger engulfing edo in the process  
the earls black orb of energy completely destroys edo the exorcists are left in various conditions though general cross group is more severely wounded lenalee however is protected by her innocence which once again encases her in a crystal-like form this form catches the earls interest and he sends tyki skin and the combined akuma to obtain her innocence kanda fights tyki lavi and marie confront skin and general tiedoll confronts the combined akuma however with all the exorcists doing battle with the noah lenalee is left unguarded giving the earl a chance to obtain her innocence himself just as he is about to kill lenalee a white arm stops him the arks gate is shown open leading directly to lenalee where allen and the earl meet face to face once again  
the battle in edo continues after greeting the earl allen vows to protect lenalee the earl retaliates and thus begins fighting allen during the fight the earl reveals some of his hidden abilities by turning lero into a sword eventually allen hits the earl with a cross grave attack but the earl seems unaffected the earl laughs and assures allen that they will continue their fight another time and he fires a purple orb of energy which causes a massive explosion when the smoke clears the earl tyki and skin are gone and the exorcists are in confusion inside the ark the earl reveals to tyki that both allen and his innocence are still alive in edo the exorcists seize their chance to heal and regroup despite general tiedolls warning of the upcoming dangers general cross group decides to keep moving forward lenalee awakens and thanks allen for trying so hard to save suman a pentacle suddenly appears on the ground and lenalee is kidnapped by lero and disappears  
lero kidnaps lenalee who is sucked into a portal seeing lenalee disappear allen reaches into the portal and is pulled in as well lavi kanda krory and chaoji follow suit soon after those who are left behind look to the sky and see a strange object in the sky general tiedoll and bookman realize that the object is the infamous noahs ark they are then attacked by a horde of combined akuma marie attacks with noel organon while tiedoll attacks with art miranda who is still tired from the previous encounters tells bookman that everyones time is still inside her innocence but any new injuries that they receive will not heal inside the ark allen and his friends see a projection of the earl who tells them that they will be deleted along with the ark in three hours the exorcists raced to find the exit that allen had previously used tyki appears and tells them that there is an exit situated at the arks highest point the top of a tower allen realizes that tyki is the noah that destroyed his innocence tyki gives them a key to roads exit door and leaves the room that the exorcists entered is occupied by the noah skin boric kanda who recognizes skin as the noah targeting general tiedoll tells the others to go ahead and prepares to challenge skin by himself  
kanda decides to fight the noah skin bolic and tells the others to go ahead they refuse and insist on staying with kanda until he finally attacks them in fury they go ahead after lenalee makes kanda promise to follow them nonetheless they worry because they know that the room will be destroyed once it finishes downloading now alone kanda fights skin one-on-one tyki mikk watches them as well as the other exorcists in a room with road skin transforms and starts battling kanda in edo marie and tiedoll continue to fight the combined akuma  
kanda superior in speed and skin superior in power fight to an apparent stalemate skin reflects on his past while barraging kanda with blasts of lightning kanda responds by using his nigentou the room shakes signaling that it will collapse soon kanda then activates his kinki sangenshiki taboo three illusions as he uses this move which drains part of his life kanda remembers a conversation that he had with komui regarding the duration of his life as well as a lotus blossom that symbolizes the amount of time that he has left suddenly chains representing skins dark energy materialize connecting kanda to skin skin uses these to throw kanda around telling him that the noah can never die finally kanda unleashes a final attack as skin falls kanda tells him that anyone can die as long as they remain mortal sure of his victory kanda heads for the exit however as he approaches it skin reawakens and prepares for his final attack  
believing he defeated skin kanda walks to the exit of the room but the numbness in his left hand and knee hinder him in addition too much of his life was consumed in the battle with skin as he is about to lose consciousness skins eyes start to bleed skin remembers three years ago when he went to see a priest who told him about noahs remembering the pain that the innocence caused his ancestors the noah revives to fight kanda once more draining more of his life kanda restores mugen momentarily and destroys him but the exit crumbles before he can leave as the room crumbles kanda thinks of his comrades and of the lotus blossom representing the remainder of his life wilting and he smiles before he disappears the room then completely collapses in edo miranda notices that someones time has vanished  
as skin boric dies the noah within the others begin to cry they then find out that general cross had escaped from the noah twins jasdero and david once again and left them with the debts road notices that allens name is on the bills while the group continues walking down the corridor the twins set several traps which involve liquor bottles and gambling allen manages to beat these challenges through his knowledge of past experiences with general cross eventually they come face to face with jasdero and david the fight begins with the twins using their guns to fire cross bills at allen before firing a bigger bullet  
the exorcists begin fighting the twins jasdero and david the twins fire several kinds of bullets blue freezes everything it touches red ball of fire and white nulls the effect of their own power the twins want allen to pay the debts general cross tricked them into paying which allen claims that they are nothing compared to those that he had soon after the twins fire a purple bullet covering the eyes of the exorcists causing them to hallucinate the twins hide from sight and allen loses roads key in a sea of illusionary copies summoned by the twins ability  
no longer visible to the group jasdero and david attack after allen fails to force them out of hiding the twins fire a new bullet the green bomb enclosing allen in an airless jelly-like blob lavi helps and reveals as he is bookmans successor he can identify the key as he searches for the key krory also reveals that he can find the twins and directs allen in successfully catching them to get out of their hold the twins release a mud-monster called jasdevis hatred on allen and krory devouring them whole the twins then take lenalee and use her as a shield angering allen who breaks free only to be kept busy by an illusionary earl with all the strength of the real one lero reveals that the twins power is materialization where when they are thinking the same thing they make it real lavi finds the key the masks and illusions disappear and the twins are visible once again they become angered from being called kids and annoyances so they merge and reveal their true form jasdevi the strongest body ever imagined  
in their combined form jasdevi has become exponentially stronger krory fights jasdevi one-on-one to allow the others time to escape when krory drinks one of his three bottles of chomesukes blood he is able to fight almost on par with jasdevi jasdevi angers him by casually calling him a vampire and a monster it reminds him of his lost love the only one allowed to call him vampire fueled by his anger krory drinks a second bottle of blood but the fight has left him too weak to break down the poison within his blood he grows weaker but tries to avoid drinking the last bottle as the fight wears on he decides that he must drink the last bottle but jasdevi takes it from him and drinks it himself with krory greatly weakened jasdevi is able to enclose him inside an iron maiden  
after krorys defeat jasdevi moves onward toward allen and the others meanwhile the dying krory encounters his lost love eliade who tells him that by dying hell lose those humans who considered him a friend more determined than ever krorys blood leaves his body and attacks jasdevi in a form created by his innocence called bloody krory this weakens jasdevi a lot and after one final clash jasdevi de-materializes into jasdero and david causing them to stop and rest ultimately falling through the door and disappearing after the room krory is in collapses allen and the rest continue their walk through the ark and come to the final room at the top of the tower where road and tyki await upon arriving at the top allen is tackled by road camelot the dreams of noah and is kissed by her there they discover that the tower is the only building left intact in the ark  
with only the tower left standing on the ark the group is now trapped inside with two noahs lenalee and lavi are shocked to learn that allens innocence has literally become part of his heart this leads lavi to speculate allen in addition to lenalee may be the heart soon after allen and tyki face off once again meanwhile road traps lenalee and chaoji and sends lavis mind and spirit to another dimension where he has to confront himself and road promised that if he survives she would release their trapped comrades  
allens battle with tyki mikk and lavis struggle with roads dream continue tyki is determined to crush allens innocence once again then allen remembers komui saying that innocence is the weakness of noah and vice versa tyki attacked allen with a strong power damaging allens innocence but it healed allen pushes his innocence to injure tykis noah within him thus tyki uses his ability to create a vacuum in the atmosphere around allen disabling his ability to breathe and suffocating him as tyki enters the vacuum to finish off allen he notices that allen is still conscious allen attempts to activate his innocence with stronger synchronization and power but tyki drives his hand into allens heart and as he is about to crush it allens body begins glowing meanwhile in the hq hevlaska is experiencing pain and chanting that a new general is coming komui and reever both suggest that it is allen back at the ark allen pushes tyki away and his forearm is transformed into a sword handle as he pulls it out he mentions that the critical point has been broken the episode ends with tyki shocked and allen wielding the sword with his left arm gone  
after exceeding critical point allens power and synch-rate with his innocence has exponentially increased his new sword which resembles the earls scares the noah upon first sight of its power as allen escapes from tykis vacuum lenalee and chaoji attempt to escape roads cell but hurt themselves in the process meanwhile tyki defends against allens innocence and remembers events from his white side and his black side allen finally breaks through the defenses and cuts him thinking he should be dead tyki and the others are confused to see he has suffered no apparent damage yet felt pain allen reveals purpose to save the human or white side of tyki mikk he pierces crown clown through tyki stigmata began forming where the cut should be and tyki begins to feel the pain of the noah inside him dying as road watches in horror allen exorcise the noah from tyki and the noahs gray skin and forehead stigmata fade away but chaoji is suddenly stabbed by roads candles after watching her family member exorcised road surrounded them with candle stakes and swore her revenge deciding to destroy lavis mind trapped within her meanwhile lavi realizes that his illusionary environment can still hurt him surrounded by his dead allies come back to life lavi prepares to attack the illusions  
in roads dream world lavi cuts down his comrades as he tries to ignore their pleads his other self looks on and lectures lavi who is soon defeated by his illusionary friends road reveals lavi was never injured but went into shock because he believed his friends stabbed him she releases lavi now controlled by his bookman heart and orders allen to kill him or lenalee and chaoji will die by her candles but allen refuses and instead stabs road but she is uninjured as it is not her true body allen is engulfed in flames but realizes that the heat is not affecting him the candles surrounding lenalee and chaoji begin to melt instead back in control of his body lavi burns himself and engulfs road in flame she still seems uninjured however until a blade pierces her body back in the dream world lavi realizes that allen in roads dream is the true road and succeeds in damaging her  
after damaging road in the dream world lavi starts to fade away however the other lavi realizes he is the exorcists real mind and returns to his body screaming lavis name allen manages to save him and the fire seal turns into stone road breaks out of the stone and is unable to move lenalee starts to believe that allen and lavi are gone but they also emerge from a pile of stone road starts to laugh hysterically until she bursts into smoke soon after the room starts to crumble when they reach the exit allen decides to save tyki but is pulled down to the floor below after the dust clears it seems something is wrong with tyki who has transformed into something terrifying  
the transformed tyki is too fast and too powerful for allen and lavi and with the door destroyed there is no way out of the ark despite that there is little hope the exorcists fight back when the tower crumbles chaoji reacts to an innocence saving his and lenalees life for the while the fight continues as allen vows to fight until his life ends meanwhile strange beings guard a large round object and seem to be defeated by one of their own  
tyki is gaining momentum while allen and lavi are weakening as allen falls through a hole he is saved by a stranger who turns out to be his master general cross marian cross singlehandedly defeats tyki with grave of maria and judgment just as he is landing the final blow the millenium earl interrupts the ark crumbles with lavi and chaoji falling into the abyss as the earl and cross face each other  
the earl and general cross share a brief conversation and when the earl mentions all of the exorcists who disappeared allen becomes enraged and attempts to fight the earl despite the fact that he is quite seriously wounded upon seeing allens new innocence the earl comments that it is just like his own sword and after trading a few blows with allen decides to take the unconscious tyki and escape the crumbling ark as allen attempts to follow the earl general cross uses the carte garde ability of his innocence grave of maria and orders allen to stop fighting the earl from his hatred the general then takes both allen and lenalee to the akuma egg plant and orders allen to control the ark and sends him and timcampy into the secret room of the 14th noah where allen faces a dark apparition in the mirror who calls timcampy my timcampy the black ark of the earl is revealed and it seems that all is lost as the original ark disappears but when allen begins to play on the white piano using a mysterious set of symbols projected by timcampy as the music the ark begins to join back together again  
allen managed to control the ark so the ark was repaired with all the exorcists who perished in the ark back to life furthermore the factory egg for creating akuma was half downloaded due to general crosss spell so it does not function chaoji then gains his innocence in the form of two bracelets interlocked as he tried to rescue the exorcists when they fell through a bottomless door a pair of interlocked bracelets attached to his left hand they suddenly realise that general cross who is a womanizer is alone with lenalee they hurry back only to discover the general and lenalee appear to be in a passionate embrace  
allen and all of his comrades return safely to the hq and miranda deactivates her innocence making the injuries the noah inflicted on the exorcists to reappear while the exorcists recover in the hospital of hq bak and other scientists study the arks ability to teleport people anywhere in the world allen goes into the piano room with tim and ponders on how the symbols he and mana created years ago were the song to move the ark elsewhere the earl becomes enraged by the fact that the 14th noah has somehow helped the exorcists obtain the ark and the akuma egg  
komui and bak meet with other branch heads and the four generals and were confronted by special inspector malcolm c levellier and his assistance howard link levellier and link outlined all the events that started in edo and proposed severe punishments for cross because of his unorthodox handling of his mission they also proposed putting allen on trial for heresy because he and cross clearly have some sort of tie with the enemy specifically the fourteenth noah cross was alarmed that leverrier knew about the fourteenth but he was confident that nothing would be turned up in any investigation thus leverrier assigned howard link to supervise allens every movement  
howard link confronts allen in the cafeteria while notifying him that he will be under surveillance after hearing howard talk to allen lenalee talks to her brother to understand the meaning of this she comes in contact with inspector malcolm c and remembers her past when she was traumatized by him the inspector said that the will of the 14th is continued by multiple people and general cross is one of them eventually allen learns that he is suspected of being related to the 14th noah and he is banned from having contact with cross and allen saw the shadow in the piano room again later on it is discovered that the science department of the order somehow removed the akuma egg from the ark to study it the heads of various branches came in and offered to help with the study of the egg as well but they were rejected by johnny then johnny was stabbed by the noah lulubell who was in disguise as one of the black order branch head andrew while hundreds of akuma appeared behind her  
the noah lulubell disguised as branch head andrew nansen and her army of akuma and skulls attack the headquarters lab 5 where the akuma egg is being studied the army injures the entire science department and intending to turn them into skulls tapp is the first to be transformed allen and bookman arrive through the ark just as reever was about to be the second lulubell orders the akuma to hold off the exorcists until she has retrieved the egg throwing allen immediately into battle lenalee and lavi attempt to reach allen but they are stopped by komui and locked into the infirmary lenlee begs komui to let her go so she can see hevlaska and re-synch with her innocence but komui refuses saying he cannot lose her meanwhile allen and bookman still struggle with the endless army of level 3 akuma lulubell opens up a gate and prepares the egg for retrieval  
allen and bookman are still fighting the akuma but lulubell has already secured the akuma egg and opened a gate to the millennium earl with nobody to help them allen and bookman struggle to keep up many of the researchers have already been transformed into skulls as bak and the rest of the survivors attempt to make a talisman outside komui arrives and malcolm criticizes him for being slow and suggesting the worst-case scenario inside lab 5 miranda lotto noise marie and the generals arrive just as the egg is being transferred and allen is kidnapped with surprising efficiency the generals take down the giant akuma take back the egg and rescue allen  
the exorcists defeat all but one combined akuma however when lulubell came back for the egg she transformed into a liquid form and the generals were unable to damage her lulubell trapped miranda inside her liquid form and escaped with the egg the generals use their anti-akuma weapons to fire at lulubell despite miranda being inside her however miranda is protected by allen so she was not harmed meanwhile johnny went looking for tapp however tapp was already a skull and thought of johnny as an enemy johnny is then swallowed up by the only remaining alive combined akuma and allen heard someone laughing foreshadowing that a level 4 is coming  
the level 4 mother akuma appears out of the remaining alive combined akuma another level 4 the baby came out of the mothers body allen is stunned at the sight of the level 4s soul and comments on how terrible it is seeing his comrades injured allen attacks the level 4 but is unable to harm it and is blasted away by a beam the level 4 screams loudly causing allen to lose synchronization and being unable to move then the level 4 destroys the floor of lab 5 causing the floor to change into a fiery pit however the people were transported by general crosss marias carte guarde to a safety place the level 4 laughs and heads towards the black order to resume its annihilation allen loses consciousness with link by his side  
the level 4 starts its attack in the central headquarters he targets komui thinking that he is an exorcist when the level 4 is trapped in a shield komui takes the opportunity to find hevlaska with kanda and chaoji following him meanwhile malcolm forces lenalee to follow him and meet hevlaska with lavi running after them when komui and kanda go down the elevator the level 4 attacks them hevlaska tries to force the innocence into lenalees body but suddenly the level 4 attacks hevlaska leaving her seriously injured lenalee tries to call out for her innocence while the level 4 steps on her head

the battle between guy and kisame intensifies guy bring outs his nunchaku to compensate for kisames samehada sword uncutes a beating from kisames water style jutsu after being submerged by kisames attacks guy resorts to opening up six of his inner gates and defeats kisame with the morning peacock technique meanwhile naruto realizes he is caught in a genjutsu that itachi cast upon him and recalls his training with jiraiya to try to dispel itachis illusion on his own  
after the bad visions that itachi makes him suffer naruto is released from the genjutsu by chiyo and sakura distracted and immobilized by kakashis shadow clone itachi takes a direct hit from narutos great ball rasengan meanwhile guy frees neji rock lee and tenten after defeating kisame later the two konoha teams find out that their opponents are yura and another rouge hiiden sand ninja named mukade who were used to create clones of itachi and kisame to function as a distraction  
kakashi and guys teams both figure out that their battles were only set-ups to delay them from rescuing gaara chiyo goes on to explain that the jinchuriki like gaara and naruto are individuals burdened with the task of carrying the tailed beasts within them and the extraction process can be fatal as the two teams rest from their battles the akatsuki leader sends out zetsu to dispose of yura and mukades corpses  
team guy and team kakashi both finish their breaks and go on towards the akatsuki lair after noticing narutos agitation towards gaaras capture kakashi explains to chiyo that naruto is himself a jinchuriki chiyo then reveals that she was the one who sealed the shukaku in gaara to protect sunagakure as the konoha teams arrive to the cave entrance to find a way in the akatsuki finishes sealing shukaku into the gedo statue with gaaras body rendered lifeless  
with the sealing ritual over the akatsuki members end their astral projection technique with deidara and sasori ordered by the akatsuki leader to dispose of the intruders while learning from itachi that one of them is the nine tails jinchuriki kakashi and guys teams find out that there is a barrier protecting the akatsuki hideout being generated by five forbidden tags in the nearby area neji pinpoints the tags locations with his byakugan and team guy dispatches to remove the tags and disables the barrier allowing team kakashi to enter the hideout with naruto furious to find gaaras lifeless body  
once removing the tag seals to open the akatsuki lairs entrance team guy is individually ambushed and attacked by exact clones of themselves inside the lair deidara angers naruto by stating gaaras death kakashi tells naruto to calm down after deidara and sasori get into an argument about what art truly is deidara takes gaaras body away within a clay bird as bait forcing naruto and kakashi to follow him sakura and chiyo remain behind to battle chiyos grandson sasori  
chiyo explains to sakura that sasori used to be one of the best puppeteers in sunagakure but he left the village after he started making puppets out of humans chiyo also reveals that sasoris true body is hiding within his favorite puppet hiruko and the only way to kill sasori is to first destroy his puppet chiyo and sakura are able to dodge sasoris poison-laced attacks and successfully demolish the puppet using sakuras strength sasori then emerges from the puppets remains just outside deidara begins telling naruto and kakashi how much stronger sasori is compared to himself  
with his puppet destroyed sasori reveals himself to chiyo and sakura looking no older than when he left his village over twenty years ago meanwhile temaris team along with kankuro and ebizo continue to make their way towards the land of rivers where ebizo tells the others of the strongest ninja in sunagakures history the third kazekage and his mysterious disappeance back in the akatsuki lair sasori summons the third kazekage puppet whom he had kidnapped and turned into a human puppet many years ago using its weapons which are even more dangerous than hirukos sasori is able to catch sakura in a cloud of poison gas  
sakura manages to escape the poison gas cloud by using an explosive scroll on herself chiyo calls forth the mother and father puppets that sasori had modeled out of his dead parents as a child to fight him with they manage to hold down the third kazekage for a while until sasori releases the thirds secret technique iron sand meanwhile team guy are having trouble fighting their clones and showing exhaustion from the battle elsewhere naruto and kakashi manage to avoid deidaras clay bombs and keep up with him  
the third kazekage being a human puppet is built to retain the chakra the body once had when it was alive allowing the third to use his special iron sand techniques the iron sand clogs the mechanism in the mother and father puppets as well as chiyos right puppet arm chiyo remembers back to when sasori was a child and created the mother and father puppets to try to get parental love chiyo uses a willing sakura as a puppet and has her dodge the iron sand techniques to get close to sasori  
sasori attacks with an iron sand pyramid and prism but sakura is able to fend them off causing the cave in the lair to fall sasori then uses the iron sand to create a makeshift globe-model out of randomly growing spikes of iron one of which hits sakura and paralyzes her with poison with one last attack from the third kazekage puppet sasori attempts to kill the seemingly helpless sakura only to discover that sakura is somehow immune to his poison and she destroys the third kazekage puppet with a single punch  
sakura reveals to sasori that she had taken an antidote to his poison that she brought with her meanwhile deidara attempts to split naruto and kakashi by creating a swarm of explosive jumping crickets out of his clay and has them pursue kakashi kakashi makes a shadow clone as a decoy and the crickets mistaking the clone for the real kakashi detonate harmlessly kakashi then catches back up with naruto and strategizes a plan sakura and chiyo ready themselves for the battle with sasori who reveals the reason behind his eternal youth he had transformed himself into a human puppet  
sakura and chiyo continue the battle with sasori who overwhelms them initially sakura manages to later destroy sasoris puppet body but he reforms back seeing this chiyo summons the ten puppets of chikamatsu which sasori counters with his one hundred puppet manipulation jutsu sakura and chiyo with the help of her ten puppets seem to trap and defeat sasori but under cover of the battle sasori secretly transfers the only living part of his body - his heart - into another puppet and tries to attack chiyo from behind sakura notices this and intercedes causing sasori to stab her through her torso  
chiyo injects the last remaining antidote into sakura and finally kills sasori by stabbing him through his heart using the father and mother puppets with sasori immobilized chiyo revives the nearly-dead sakura using her resurrection technique as he dies sasori tells sakura where he had planned to meet with one of his spies who had been secretly working as one of his former akatsuki partner orochimarus subordinates meanwhile as kakashi and naruto are pursuing deidara kakashi reveals his plan to activate his version of the mangekyo sharingan  
team guy continues to fight their clones neji explains to each member of the team that they are growing weaker as the fight drags on and their clones being non-human remain as strong as they were when they were formed lee realizes that the only way for them to defeat their clones is to become stronger than they were when they first started fighting after remembering their training they remember their resolve to constantly become stronger this gives them the strength needed to overpower and destroy their clones  
kakashi reveals his mangekyo sharingan and uses his interdimensional warping technique kamui to try to warp deidara but succeeds only in warping his arm while deidara has his guard down naruto manages to separate him from his clay bird and has his clones retain gaaras body from the birds mouth naruto attacks deidara only to discover that he is beating up a clay clone angered narutos nine-tailed fox chakra begins to emerge leading naruto to transform to his two-tailed form  
after naruto is taken over by the nine-tailed foxs chakra kakashi uses a seal that jiraiya gave him to suppress it team guy finds deidara thanks to nejis byakugan and seeing the pursuing team deidara seemingly self-detonates by ingesting his own clay and exploding however the explosion is countered by kakashis kamui who is able to warp it to a different dimension just in time meanwhile sakura fails to bring gaara back to life and the group mourns gaaras death seeing narutos emotions as a friend for gaara chiyo moves over to gaaras body and uses a life-transfer jutsu to resurrect him  
chiyo finishes her life-transfer jutsu after naruto volunteers to her to use his chakra with her dying chakra as she continues the technique she begins to reflect on how konoha and sunagakure have acted in the past and she passes down to naruto and sakura her wisdom for the future a revived gaara finds himself surrounded by shinobi from sunagakure celebrating his return temari and kankuro soon reveal that chiyo gave her life to rescue gaara shocking naruto gaara asks his villagers to mourn for chiyo  
after team kakashi and team guy return gaara to sunagakure they pay their final respects to chiyos grave the konoha ninja then make the return trip to their village after naruto and gaara shake hands meanwhile revealed to had used a clone to fake his death the real deidara emerges from hiding and begins to search for his arm upon finding his arm deidara meets zetsu and his masked subordinate tobi who have just obtained sasoris ring with the latter wishing to join the akatsuki in konoha an elderly ninja gives an emotionless ninja codenamed sai instructions for a secret mission where he is to become a member of team kakashi  


in konoha kakashi rests in a hospital while sakura tells tsunade what the deceased akatsuki member sasori told her that he was supposed to meet a spy within orochimarus ranks at the tenchi bridge in ten days time as four days had already passed naruto realizes the need of another teammate and so starting searching konoha for a willing recruit he runs into team 8 but they are unable to help as they are assigned a mission of their own later just as choji agrees to help naruto the two and shikamaru are attacked by sai  
unable to identify sai naruto choji and shikamaru attempt to capture him but sai withdraws concerned that akatsuki might soon come to konoha looking for the nine-tailed fox the village elders confront tsunade they propose to tsunade to keep naruto in konoha and not send him to missions outside the village tsunade declines and promises to protect konoha with her own life if naruto is captured but she is still forced to compromise with the foundations leader danzo shimura in having sai made a member to team kakashi with kakashi in the hospital tsunade temporarily replaces him with anbu member code-named yamato the anbu operative is given the task to keep an eye on sai later naruto and sakura meet their new team members and naruto is immediately angered upon sais appearance  
yamato takes leadership of team kakashi while sai devoid of any human feelings or emotions insults both naruto and sakura while preparing to set off sai receives an envelope from an anbu root shinobi containing secret orders from danzo jiraiya then meets with tsunade and yamato in kakashis hospital room to brief yamato on the nine-tailed fox sealed within naruto detailing the demon foxs cloak and revealing a huge scar on his chest he got from naruto when the boy lost control after he ascended to a four-tailed form finally the new team kakashi sets off on their new mission to capture and intercept the spy in orochimarus subordinates and gather information about sasuke  
team kakashi heads out for the tenchi bridge sakura and naruto come down hard at sai for making fun of their former teammate sasuke seeing the tension in the team yamato decides they need to improve on teamwork and uses the wood style jutsu to create a wooden cage threatening to lock the trio up unless they behave sakura is shocked to see yamato using the secret techniques that only the first hokage was said to possess given an ultimatum between being locked up or spending the night at a hot springs by yamato the team chooses to visit the springs to improve team cohesion despite this fact naruto still despises sai  
sakura sees sai drawing by a river and finds out that he has artistic talent but has never given titles to anything he ever drew naruto and sakura begin to realize the reason behind sais repulsive personality after the hot springs the team heads off to the tenchi bridge to meet with sasoris spy yamato being suspicious of traps suggests to the team to alter their route and go through a forest camping for the night yamato then creates a two story house by again using his wood style jutsu inside the house the team formulates their plan of capturing the spy  
yamato decides to have a mock test for his team to see how everyone coordinates with each other naruto is paired with sai despite his objections and sakura is assigned to support yamato yamato conducts a simulation of the meeting with himself as the spy to gauge naruto and sais abilities and teamwork after naruto makes a mistake sai immobilizes him and goes off alone naruto is angered with sai for not acting as a comrade would but resolves to work together with him to get sasuke back sai then reveals to sakura that he has no emotions and little understanding of them as a part of his training in anbu root  
yamato disguises himself as sasori within hiruko and goes to meet the spy at the tenchi bridge the spy is revealed to be kabuto who spills out the location of orochimarus current hideout before the meeting could finish orochimaru appears and interrupts the two while kabuto initially seems frightened by orochimarus appearance it turned out to be a ruse as he attacks the disguised yamato after telling kabuto that the figure is not sasori orochimaru recognizes yamato as one of the test subjects in his experiments to replicate hashiramas power through blood transfusion of the first hokages dna orochimaru also knows that yamato is not alone as he tells him to call out naruto sakura and sai from their hiding places  
yamato signals naruto sakura and sai to appear on the bridge on seeing naruto orochimaru begins mocking him and compares him to sasuke which causes the nine-tailss chakra to leak from an enraged narutos body and ascends him to a three-tailed form meanwhile yamato remembers jiraiya speaking of the appearance of number of tails on naruto during their training and had specifically warned of narutos four-tailed transformation  
naruto gets more enraged in his three-tailed state and throws kabuto away who inadvertedly knocks sakura out too narutos anger eventually escalates to him destroying the tenchi bridge and he takes to a forest to battle orochimaru sai creates an ink bird and flies beneath the collapsing bridge to the site of naruto and orochimarus battle instead of catching a falling sakura yamato saves her using his wood style jutsu and creates a wood clone to follow sai in the forest narutos ever-increasing aggression causes his blood to mix with the nine-tailss chakra as his chakra cloak envelops him in the form of a four-tailed miniature fox  
naruto in his four-tailed form attacks orochimaru and devastates the surrounding landscape also preventing sai and yamatos wood clone from approaching him the majority of orochimarus attacks prove to be ineffective against naruto but he still manages to keep up with naruto with his regeneration jutsu meanwhile kabuto advances toward sakura and yamato deducing that sasori has died orochimaru finally manages to strike naruto with his kusanagi sword even though he fails to pierce the sword through him seeing naruto in his four-tailed state sakura is awestruck and terrified  
kabuto states that narutos current form is a consequence of his desperation to bring back sasuke to konoha sakura begins to cry and tries to approach naruto but is attacked by him yamato erects chakra-suppressing wooden pillars using his wood style to bind naruto before he does any more harm kabuto heals sakura and disappears after reasoning that the konoha ninja are not orochimarus enemies because they are also fighting the akatsuki yamato forcibly returns naruto to his normal state meanwhile sai who was hiding nearby the battlefield the entire time confronts orochimaru on behalf of orders from danzo  
sakura tries to heal naruto but her medical ninjutsu has little effect on his wounds in the forest orochimaru tries to kill sai but it is revealed to be an ink clone the real sai emerges from the ground and gives orochimaru a letter from danzo sai then leaves with orochimaru and kabuto for their hideout with yamatos wood clone on their trail after naruto comes to his senses the team reaches the battlefield spot and picks up sais picture book from what his clone observed yamato infers that danzo seeks to destroy konoha with orochimarus aid  
to confuse and slow down yamatos wood clone kabuto creates a fake corpse resembling sai naruto still recovering from the effects of his four-tailed state is told to stay behind by yamato however naruto tells yamato he is fine and the trio continue to follow sai during their pursuit the team is forced to take a break when sakuras own injuries take their toll on her as she heals herself yamato talks to naruto in solace and tells him that it was he in his four-tailed form who hurt sakura naruto is shocked to know this and condemns his own actions  
yamato tells naruto not to rely on the nine-tails chakra as he is strong enough on his own the konoha team decides to browse sais book to give them some clue about him and they notice that its filled with the story of two boys paths and battles however the pages where the two boys would meet are unfinished meanwhile orochimarus group reach their hideout not realizing that yamatos wood clone had spotted them there sai confronts a shadowed sasuke realizing that this is the man whom naruto and sakura have been searching for  
sai is temporarily trapped in a powerful genjutsu from sasukes sharingan that frightens him after recovering sai tells sasuke that naruto sees him as a brother as told to him by sakura sasuke replies that he has only one brother the one he is going to kill and leaves orochimaru gives the envelope with information from danzo about konohas anbu to kabuto and instructs him to make a bingo book on reaching near orochimarus hideout yamato gives sakura and naruto wooden seeds to ingest which are imbued with his chakra that would enable him to track them down in case they are lost and reveals that he was able to track sai with the same seeds that he had secretly fed sai in the hideout kabuto locks sai in a room and the latter summons a bingo book of the same information in the envelope outside yamato uses a earth style jutsu to open a tunnel into orochimarus hideout and he naruto and sakura travel to sais room undetected  
yamato and his team enter sais room and confront him sai tells them that not only was he to help in konohas destruction but also act as a spy against orochimaru yamato reveals that in anbu root one must murder his own comrades and sever their emotions but sakura returns sais picture book to him remarking that he still has emotions because he treasures it afterwards the team ties up sai once outside naruto informs sai about his bonds of a brother with sasuke and about how far he would go to bring sasuke back  
before yamatos team departs to find sasuke in the hideout kabuto appears in front of them and attacks them before freeing sai however sai wanting to learn more about his own bonds with his deceased brother through narutos bond with sasuke betrays kabuto and aids yamato in his capture a tied up kabuto gives a vague description of sasukes location to the team thinking that orochimaru would just kill them either way leaving yamatos wood clone to watch over kabuto yamato and his team enter orochimarus hideout and they split up to find sasuke naruto and sai heading one way with sakura and yamato to another  
as the konoha team continues their search for sasuke naruto suddenly collapses due to exhaustion from his previous battle with orochimaru as naruto wakes up sai remembers what he wanted to draw in the middle pages of his picture book him and his brother smiling an action which sai mirrors as sai talks about his bonds orochimaru suddenly appears and attacks them sakura and yamato come to narutos aid while sai goes alone to continue the search just as sai finds sasuke with his ink rats yamato finds sais bingo book and realizes sais actual mission upon finding sasuke listed as a target for assassination  
yamato suggests that sais true objective is to kill sasuke who according to his master danzo is a threat to konoha sai enters sasukes room and wakes him up but instead of following his orders and killing sasuke sai reveals that he wants to preserve naruto and sasukes bonds sasuke retaliates by causing a giant explosion in his room which attracts sakura naruto and yamatos attention as naruto and sakura meet with their former friend sai declares that he is discarding his mission orders and now wishes to aid naruto in bringing sasuke back to konoha  
with his skills immensely improved over the years sasuke begins to attack naruto but sai intervenes sasuke keeps the two at bay with his chidori current sakura decides to charge at sasuke but yamato jumps in front of her only to wind up being stabbed by sasukes chidori-infused katana deep within his conscious remembering what yamato told him naruto attempts to resist the nine-tailss goading before the fox attempts to goad naruto to using its power however sasuke uses his sharingan to enter narutos mind and stop him from reaching the nine tails with sasuke meeting him for the first time the nine tails compares sasukes chakra to that of madara uchiha before being totally suppressed by the young uchiha as his chakra dissipates the nine-tails warns sasuke not to kill naruto  
just as sasuke is about to execute a powerful jutsu to finish the team orochimaru followed by kabuto appears and stops him orochimaru and kabuto convince sasuke to leave his former team mates alive to weaken the akatsukis numbers for him forced to watch sasuke leave with orochimaru a weeping naruto laments failing to bring their friend back to konoha before sakura reassures him that they will get another chance back in konoha tsunade receives yamatos reports and is greatly angered over danzos treachery of leaking classified information of konoha anbu to orochimaru in the anbu root base sai asks danzo to allow him to remain longer with team kakashi as well as keep his name danzo reluctantly agrees later sai goes on a mission with his team having come to see them as his friends

kakashi is released from the hospital and begins narutos training program naruto learns that he has wind-style chakra yamato helps by setting up the training field with his special jutsu naruto also learns that he can use his multi shadow clone jutsu to speed up his training since whatever the clones learn the original user learns upon the clones dispersal naruto and his mass of clones each take a leaf and attempt to slice it in half with wind chakra as the first step to creating his new jutsu

it is the seventh day of the new year in grand jipangu nami sanji and chopper are on their way to the shoguns castle delivering a large quantity of rice cakes to be thrown from the castle most of the townspeople have gathered there hoping to catch the one cake containing a precious jewel buggy and his henchmen have made several plans to seize the cakes including the one with the jewel before they reach their destination although his plans fail buggy manages to take princess vivi hostage however detective luffy shows up in time to thwart his efforts in the end the cakes are safe and everyone eats until they are satisfied  
having taken three rumble balls chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct driven version of himself kumadori goes all out to defeat his enemy but in the end cannot succeed in kalifas room nami lies helplessly on the ground watching her opponent casually bathing slowly the strength returns to her limbs while kalfi redresses shortly into their fight nami discovers the essence of kalifas new ability being a soap woman she can create a foam that washes away anything even a persons strength chopper goes on a rampage and with franky on his heels climbs the towers outside walls having crossed the underground passage luffy finally catches up to lucci  
on the courthouse plaza the marines defeat oimo and kāshī and capture the straw hats allies in the courthouse almost on the bridge of hesitation which leads through the gates of justice spandam tries to contact the cp9 members at the tower but accidentally invokes a buster call causing ten battleships and five vice-admirals to be dispatched to enies lobby from the nearby navy headquarters realizing his first mistake spandam makes another by informing the whole island of the coming threat out of fear the islands 10000 soldiers leave their prisoners and flee to the coast  
lucci and luffy begin their mutually anticipated duel while nami and kalifas fight enters the next phase both combatants have scouted out each others abilities kalifa attempts to finish nami off just then chopper in his monstrous form crushes through the wall and enters the fight he does not recognize nami just as he did not recognize franky as he goes through the room he rips out kalifas large bathing tub and throws it downstairs where the immobilized sanji is sitting nami is deeply worried about chopper but before she can help him she has to finish her fight the torn up water pipes sprinkling the rooms air provide a possible advantage for her  
the fight between nami and kalifa climaxes kalifa sweeps the room with a tidal wave of power-draining bubbles to counter namis illusions barely escaping nami manages to prepare and release her finishing blow in the form of a horizontal lighting bolt franky who had followed chopper in climbing up the walls of the tower of law arrives as she is about to retrieve kalifas key a moments discussion later they conceive of a plan they follow chopper into the room where zoro and sogeking still cuffed together try to fight kaku and jyabura there franky uses his air pressure cannon to blast chopper outside and into the sea while nami uses kalifas key to release zoro and sogeking from their shackles  
having pulled the once-again tiny but now completely unconscious chopper out of the sea franky ponders on how he can cross the wild waters to reach the bridge of hesitation chimeney and gonbe appear outside the secret passage and lead him to kokoro and the underground tunnel in the last remaining fight at the tower of law zoro and kaku exchange heavy blows while jyabura takes on sogeking and nami the latter fight ends quickly as jyabura holding the unmoving body of sogeking aims his killing blow just then sanji freed from the influence of kalifas power by the water of the bathtub that chopper had thrown downstairs earlier steps in taking his place in the fight  
nami drags the wounded sogeking from the fighting zone as she is on the verge of going downstairs sogeking has an idea meanwhile sanji starts exchanging blows with jyabura who sends him flying into the hallway continuing their fight there jyabura tries in vain to trick sanji with a made-up story of being robins long-lost brother the battle seems even until the wolf-man gains the upper hand over his opponent with well-placed blows realizing that he is on the losing side sanji resolves to use his newest technique he spins around until his leg starts glowing red with heat and defeats jyabura in a fierce mid-air final  
spandam drags robin along the bridge of hesitation while beneath them lucci is blocking the way upstairs franky arrives and offers to help fight lucci however luffy insists that franky save robin reminded of himself when he was young and tried to stop the sea train from carrying away his mentor franky agrees to do so though he has to get past lucci at the same time in the tower of law kaku shows zoro the many tricks he can perform with his body that is now equipped with devil fruit powers discovering new techniques in the process  
after many failed attempts zoro finally cuts kaku shortly afterwards their fight climaxes as both combatants use their ultimate techniques the victor is zoro on the other side of the raging waters on the bridge of hesitation spandam continues to drag robin along fear strikes her as the end of the bridge which for her marks the point of no return comes into sight she pulls herself free and runs away spandam pursues and recaptures her but she holds on to the rim of the bridge with her teeth below them franky tries in vain to force his way past the much more powerful lucci as franky is on the verge of being killed luffy activates gear second and attacks lucci allowing franky to slip by  
having loosened robins tooth grip on the bridges rim spandam ties a rope around her waist and pulls her further along during this he constantly insults her and proudly tells her that spandaine the man who had caused her so much suffering is his father a stream of tears runs down her cheeks as her time runs out just then and seemingly out of nowhere an explosive projectile hits the back of spandams head a stream of projectiles falls on the marines gathered around him outside the range of normal guns sogeking is shooting at them standing on top of the tower of law  
freed from her sea stone handcuffs by franky robin returns to her normal self with no way back the two decide to capture the ship spandam had intended to use to bring robin to the navy headquarters the buster call ships arrive and start by shooting at the tower of law causing its dangerously positioned upper half to crush down into the waterfall the resulting loud noise created reaches luffy and lucci beneath the bridge of hesitation anticipating that the straw hats would emerge through the underground passage lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber flooding it and the passage  
it is springtime in grand jipangu one day remains until the yearly town festival in which everyone gathers to have a picnic under the 1000-year-old sakura tree unfortunately one of the towns children is sick and cannot attend luffy tries to think of a way to show him the tree in its bloom but does not come up with a solution when the tree disappears the next day luffy becomes the prime suspect robin investigates the truth is that buggy and his men stole the tree and brought it aboard the ship of foxy the silver fox she tips off luffy usopp and sanji about the trees location who go there to retrieve it  
the buster call ships have reached the island guns blazing they pass the bridge of hesitation at the same time the remaining straw hats kokoro chimeney and gonbe have entered the underground passage and are running towards the water streaming in on the other end meanwhile luffy and lucci having fled from the rising water continue their fight a few levels higher because the effects of his gear second have worn off luffy is at a disadvantage however he has another trump card he activates gear third blows air into his arm until it reaches the size of that of a giant and knocks lucci out of the pillar  
fifteen years into the past a 13-year-old rob lucci as emissary of the world government is sent into a country at war with pirates five hundred of their soldiers have been taken hostage and the pirates captain demands the throne in exchange for the mens life the countrys king is close to giving in when lucci arrives however lucci has not come to offer help but to take matters into his hands he goes to the pirates and allows them to capture him they lock him up with the five hundred soldiers lucci kills them all in the name of justice because for a soldier it is a sin to be weak afterwards he kills the pirates captain and ends the countrys crisis  
after fighting lucci in gear third for a minute luffy is left to cope with the techniques side effect of his body shrinking to a fraction of its original size for around the same time at the other end of the bridge of hesitation franky takes on funkfreed spandams sword infused with the powers of a devil fruit which allow it to partly or completely turn into an elephant at the islands entry the two giants arrive carrying the galley-la foremen and the franky family on their shoulders instead of finding a means of escape however they are greeted by the cannon muzzles of three of the buster calls battleships equally desperate is the situation in the underground passage where the group has been caught in the flooding-in water just as they are about to give up hope a mermaid comes to their rescue  
franky and robin are throwing the last remaining marines off their commandeered convoy ship when kokoro in mermaid form jumps out of the water and on board carrying the whole group from the underground passage a moment of happiness arises as they reunite with robin but does not last long the battleships have set the whole island aflame and via loudspeaker a voice announces the destruction of the group of escapees at the main gate with no more targets left the fleet turns its attention toward the bridge of hesitation where the straw hats are forced to wait for their captains arrival  
the fight between luffy and lucci is nearing its end as the cp9 assassin makes use of his most powerful technique the six kings gun the bridge of hesitation is surrounded by battleships which using their cannons sever the bridges first pillar where luffy is fighting from the rest having cut off the straw hats captains retreat the marines send their two hundred strongest fighters to recapture robin meanwhile luffy is no longer able to stand up to luccis attacks and falls to the ground  
while the rest of the straw hats struggle to hold their own against the buster calls fighting elite usopp unmasked cannot believe his eyes seeing luffy lying in the dust in front of lucci he cries out to him telling him to hang in and stand up however luffy cannot move in his desperation he insults lucci dares him to cross the destroyed bridge and fight him presuming luffy to be defeated lucci is about to follow usopps suggestion however luffy gets back on his feet and activates gear second in preparation for the final round lucci hits him one more time with his six kings gun and is sure of victory however luffy does not fall he turns around and ends the fight with a barrage of blows  
familiar voices are heard from the navys loudspeakers calling in from the far side of the island the franky family and galley-la foremen are telling them that they survived and have found a means of escape the straw hats are not so fortunate their stolen convoy ship is blown up by a salvo of battleship fire another salvo destroys the second half of the bridge of hesitation forcing the pirates onto the middle pillar the situation worsens as the marines see the state of luffy worn out from the fight and from overusing gear second he cannot move or run as the battleships aim their mighty cannons at him things seem hopeless until the group hears another voice calling out to them they jump into the ocean  
the voice had come from the straw hats ship the going merry sanji is the first to go aboard to his surprise nobody is there the ship had made it from water 7 to enies lobby on its own the straw hats have little time to spare because the battleships have already taken aim at the tiny ship that has snuck in between them they fire a salvo almost from point-blank range but miss while absent earlier sanji found the control room for the gates of justice and set it to close the large gate in its original position creates whirl streams strong enough to disturb the battleships aim as well as their ability to maneuver which allows the straw hats to escape  
enies lobby and the buster call fleet are out of sight the straw hats meet the galley-la president iceburg and his employees aboard their company ship the going merry breaks apart and luffy begs the shipwrights to repair the beloved ship but they refuse iceburg then describes how he had found the ship lying at the shore and had done everything to fix it convincing luffy to let it go reminiscing about their adventures together the straw hats burn their old ship and watch as it sinks to the bottom of the sea  
two days later and back in water 7 franky hears that the item has arrived he had used the money which he had stolen from the straw hats to buy a large piece of precious wood using the wood he plans to build a dream ship and offers to give it to the straw hats the promise of a new ship and the recovery of their lost possessions from a group of galley-la workers brightens the straw hats outlook however another cloud darkens the horizon as a group of marines led by vice-admiral garp break into their quarters  
garp is revealed to be luffys grandfather and is accompanied by old acquaintances of luffy and zoro from the beginning of their journey coby and helmeppo after giving luffy a lecture for becoming a pirate instead of a marine he tells him about his father monkey d dragon although luffy does not know of it he was once saved by him in loguetown where he was almost captured by captain smoker  
garp takes his leave to let luffy alone with coby and helmeppo so that they can chat afterwards coby thanks luffy and zoro for the opportunity to meet them again and promises to become stronger so he might one day capture them once he and helmeppo depart the straw hats start a party at the galley-las company pool during that party aokiji approaches robin while staying out of sight he explains to her that saul was his best friend and that he had only let her go to honor his wishes he admits that he had decided to put an end to robins existence always on the run and the danger it meant for the world but that her and the straw hats actions have shown him that she has found her place  
a fleet of navy ships could not keep the red-haired shanks and whitebeard from meeting those unprepared to bear his presence fall unconscious to the ground as shanks walks over the planks of whitebeards ship carrying a large bottle of booze while they drink they reminisce about old times and wounds which begin aching again shanks asks his peer to stop his subordinate portgas d ace from pursuing blackbeard whitebeard refuses the two draw their weapons and fight  
luffy and chopper help a girl named abi to search for her lost yagara bull which had appeared to her in a dream during the aqua laguna her family had left their 100-year-old bull at home when they returned after the storm he was gone the three search all over the city for him with no success another yagara claims to have heard the missing ones voice after finding a piece of his scarf they track him into the underwater passages of the city however they only find an illusion abi is devastated then they hear the voice of a yagara baby wrapped in the rest of the old ones scarf  
zoro strolls the city in search of a replacement katana but does not have money there he is picked up by michael and hoichael two idle boys from the backstreets they show him around and call him their big brother before he knows what is happening he is introduced to their mother is taken home with them and has to feed babies and make laundry he struggles to escape eventually succeeding shortly afterward the family is taken away by violent debt collectors alerted by one of the boys zoro arrives just in time to save them  
sanji is buying groceries in the company of chimeney and gonbe for lunch they lead him to the small floating restaurant of a drunken old man he is asleep and not easily woken so sanji decides to prepare something himself while he is cooking the old man wakes up and immediately recognizes sanjis way of handling the carving knife for he knew sanjis mentor red-leg zeff he insists that sanji taste some of his cooking sanji is amazed by the flavor but cannot figure out how the old man made it intent on discovering the secret he searches the city for seasonings that might have been used perchance he gets to eat an onigiri made by the old man and realizes that he uses a special salt the salt was created by aqua laguna as the storm floods the lower parts of the city it covers the buildings with sea water in the following sunny days particularly tasty residual salt is left on the rooftops  
franky iceburg and the galley-la foremen work throughout the night to build the new ship for the straw hats usopp spends the time practicing the manner in which he will convince his former crewmates to let him join again the next day the straw hats are summoned to the shore to receive their ship on departing they are intercepted by the franky family bringing the new wanted posters of the crew however the true reason they came is that franky has received a bounty as well they fear that should he stay with them he might be captured once more and that they would not be able to rescue him again therefore they beg the straw hats to take franky with them regardless of whether he wants them to or not  
when the straw hats arrive at the coast iceburg shows them the ship but franky cannot be found iceburg gives his opinion franky is hiding because if he were asked face to face to join the crew he would not be able to refuse he wants to go but thinks of staying in water 7 as his responsibility on the other side of the island frankys men literally take the matter into their own hands they steal frankys beloved jammer-style swimsuit and attempt to lure him to the straw hats by passing it back and forth to each other midway sanji and zoro seize him put him into the franky familys shoot-anything-cannon and have him shot in front of the new ship  
luffy tells franky that if he wants his swimsuit back he will have to join his crew however this does not persuade him to weaken his resolve robin uses her ability to grab frankys testicles and pulls on them iceburg tells him that he only wants to stay in water 7 because he has not forgiven himself frankys followers bring him his luggage he rejects it telling them to stay out of his affairs during this series of events franky cries apparently from the pain inflicted by robin who had stopped some time ago sanji and zoro arrive in a hurry reporting that garp has returned and is on his way to capture them luffy then returns the swimsuit to franky who subsequently agrees to join the crew  
the straw hats set sail even though usopp has not yet returned to them because zoro had promised that if usopp was allowed to return without his first words being an apology zoro would leave himself even if they wanted to wait longer they could not because garp has arrived and under direct orders of fleet-admiral sengoku starts throwing cannonballs at the straw hats ship while the straw hats fend of the cannonballs usopp arrives at the coast and tries to rejoin the crew as if nothing happened minding zoros words neither he nor luffy admit hearing usopps calling in the midst of battle only afterward usopp realizes his fault and begs for forgiveness luffy tearfully reaches out and pulls him aboard  
because the crew and ship are complete again the straw hats can intensify their efforts to escape they name their new ship thousand sunny and franky goes to the engine room to activate one of its special abilities luffy says goodbye to his grandfather and coby enraged by his grandsons audacity garp pulls out a gigantic iron ball and throws it at him and his ship at the last second the sunnys emergency acceleration device activates and blasts the ship a kilometer away and outside garps reach meanwhile the crews wanted posters and news of their deeds at enies lobby circulate around the world  
three days earlier and on an island close to water 7 blackbeard receives the news of the straw hats devastation of enies lobby and decides to pursue them however his plans are interrupted by ace who has come to avenge blackbeards murder of a crewmate teach claims that he had no other choice for the man he killed possessed the devil fruit he wanted which he had been searching for his entire life he then asks ace to join him however ace refuses they start fighting and blackbeard reveals his newfound power the power of darkness the island is devastated and ace defeated  
after departing water 7 the straw hats find a drifting ship with hungry and sick fishermen all things seem great until the drifting fishermen have something else in mind and set a trap for the straw hats  
the straw hats find themselves surrounded by a fleet of marine ships actually illusions they escape using the soldier dock system with the fishermen in tow chopper meanwhile is told by jiro about their past of being the phoenix pirates under puzzle the accino family meanwhile pledges to collect the straw hats heads  
trapped by moving icebergs the straw hats try to figure a way out avoiding numerous dangers as the assassins draw closer the phoenix pirate puzzle awakes after choppers treatment only to reveal some harsh realities on the awaiting crew the thousand sunny is trapped by ice by three of the assassins however it escapes using the coup de burst zoro as usual is lost after severing a blocking iceberg in half and in an iceberg attack the rope attached to the phoenix pirate ship is severed leaving behind luffy and chopper their pirate flag is then stolen by a little girls flying fish  
using the shark submarine nami and franky find out that penguins are moving the icebergs afterwards they are attacked by hockera usopp and sanji are knocked off the sunny by an iceberg and encounter sarco and albelle luffy and chopper along with the rest of the phoenix pirates are attacked by blindo and lil the little girl appears before robin back on the sunny finally zoro stumbles upon lovely land the accino familys hq the fight between the accino family and the straw hats begin

due to more of sanjis blundering he and usopp find themselves captured by sarco and albelle meanwhile canpacino arrives at the phoenix pirates ship to rescue his brother due to their brotherly love the two are human magnets and use their unique fighting style to separate luffy from the others zoro meanwhile encounters the don after knocking back a few drinks together the straw hats jolly roger is delivered and zoros 120 million bounty is quite a hard thing to pass up  
the don reveals the power of the heat heat fruit the power to melt any substance zoro is no match against his anger and ends up imprisoned inside an ice cavern along with the other captured straw hats they manage to escape thanks to some indirect assistance from robin who is still with lil luffys fight with blindo and canpacino ends in a draw when the two leave to calm down the don puzzle finally overcomes his depression and resolves to follow luffy chopper and jiro to lovely land to recover the pirate flags  
the formerly captured staw hats finally manage to get outside no thanks to zoro where they once again encounter the accinos the rematches turn out to be in the straw hats favor as hockera is taken down by franky and chopper albelle and sarco by nami and sanji and after a protracted battle luffy smashes blindo right back into lovely land puzzle showing newfound confidence then confronts canpacino but all the ruckus arouses the don meanwhile robin is taken hostage by lil to coerce her into promising to stay in lovely land  
the heat heat fruit gives the don all sorts of powers from throwing blasts of heat heating his skin to extreme temperatures to even being able to fly by blowing steam out his nose how can luffy win when he can barely even hit his enemy meanwhile puzzle defeats canpacino the rest of the straw hats search for their flag and robin and lil reconcile with one another outside the fight really heats up when luffy activates gear second but the don isnt going to fall so easily  
after a grueling struggle luffy finally defeats the don with a red-hot bazooka with a little help from lil the two stolen flags are finally recovered and the crew manages to get it back on the ship before luffy returns the defeated accinos sail away with the don in tow and finally have a belated birthday celebration while albelle makes up with her sister the phoenix pirates go to battle with canpaccino and the remaining grunts puzzle promising to meet the straw hats again in the new world

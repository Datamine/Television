videl is obsessed with discovering the real identity of the saiyaman and even suspects gohan when she gets in trouble fighting some terrorists who have kidnapped the mayor of satan city gohan has to go save the day he arrives and easily takes care of most of the gang but finds that videl is strong enough to take them out herself  
a dinosaur friend of gotens is kidnapped and taken to the circus gohan as saiyaman decides to take him back to his parents before they go on a rampage in the city but is stopped by videl who thinks hes stealing the baby dinosaur when the dinosaur parents arrive everyone finds out that saiyaman was right and after a brief skirmish the parents are able to fly away safely with their baby unfortunately for gohan videl found out that he is the great saiyaman she says that she will divulge his secret to the press unless he enters the world martial arts tournament and teaches her to fly  
gohan tells bulma trunks and vegeta that hell be participating in the world martial arts tournament after vegeta says that he too will enter goku suddenly speaks up and says that he will be allowed to come back for one day to compete excited gohan flies off to tell krillin the good news krillin and his wife android 18 each decide to enter as well even piccolo says that hell participate he and goten begin training  
gohan begins training for the world tournament and he takes goten along during the training goten reveals that he can become a super saiyan at nearly half the age gohan didtheir training is interrupted by videl who has arrived to take her first flying lesson he also reveals that trunks is stronger than him  
gohan begins teaching videl and goten how to fly goten quickly manages to manipulate his chi and fly but videl has difficulties she ends up managing to fly as well in the meantime vegeta gets a nasty surprise when his son trunks transforms into a super saiyan during a training session he wondered when the transformation was reduced to a childs play thing he is relieved though to find out that trunks is still a little stronger than goten  
videl finally manages to fly with ease allowing gohan to resume training with goten for the tournament the day soon arrives and most of the z fighters show up to participate including gohan goten piccolo vegeta trunks android 18 and krillin when they arrive at the tournament grounds goku appears and sees his son goten for the first time  
the tournament officials announce that there are only sixteen spots in the tournament and the defending champion hercule is automatically granted a spot so they decide the final fifteen spots with a punching machine although the z fighters try to take it easy their scores still far outstrip the rest of the competition vegeta however does not take it easy and completely obliterates the machine  
just before the junior competition a film is shown depicting hercules triumph over cell only the z fighters and hercule himself know it is a fraud meanwhile trunks runs into a bully in the waiting room and it turns out that his first match is against this kid with two swift kicks trunks effortlessly dispatches this bully  
its gotens turn now and he happens to be fighting the brother of the kid that trunks knocked out goten doesnt seem to understand that the other kids dont have the awesome abilities that he and trunks have and wonders why his opponent wont fight seriously he finally takes this kid out and makes his way to the finals where he faces trunks their battle rocks the stadium and the spectators love it so far its an even match  
the match between goten and trunks begins to heat up trunks gets goten in a stranglehold and goten cannot seem to break free desperate he transforms into a super saiyan and busts loose trunks is angry because all of the saiyan warriors agreed not to transform during the tournament to embarrass him for this trunks decides to fight the rest of the way without using his left arm but when goten seems to have the advantage he uses his left arm and transforms into a super saiyan to knock goten out of the ring trunks says that since both he and goten transformed once theyre even  
as promised hercule begins a match with the junior world champion which happens to be trunks trunks thinks that hercule is as strong as he says he is so he is expecting a real bout hercule in an attempt to trick trunks instructs the boy to give him the lightest punch he can unfortunately for hercule trunks lightest punch knocks the champion out of the ring though luckily it is played off as if he let trunks win while waiting for the adult tournament to begin goku and his friends run into two weird-looking strangers one of whom says he looks forward to fighting goku  
trunks and goten decide to sneak into the adult tournament they knock out a masked fighter and take his costume with goten acting as the legs and trunks as the head it is learned that the names of the two mysterious strangers are shin and kibito the tournament draws are out and in the first round goku will be fighting vegeta but before that krillin videl and piccolo who is fighting under the pseudonym majunior are scheduled to fight their respective matches  
in the first match krillin easily defeats his incredibly large opponent now its piccolos turn to fight the mysterious shin once the match starts piccolo seems to be paralyzed with fear suddenly he realizes who shin is and forfeits the match he tells goku that shin is unimaginably strong videl and the large spopovich fight next  
videls fight with spopovich begins she seems to have the upper hand in this bout but every time she knocks him down he gets back up even when it seems impossible as the fight continues spopovich begins to take the upper hand to counter videl deals him a ferocious kick to the head this kick turns spopovichs head all the way around although it seems like he is dead he suddenly gets back up and straightens his head out meanwhile shin reveals to piccolo that he is the supreme kai he gives him no more details but tells piccolo to keep it a secret  
spopovich starts wailing on videl and theres nothing she can do about it when it seems like he is about to deal out her final blow gohan decides that hes seen too much and goes out to rescue her suddenly yamu spopovichs partner tells him to stop punishing videl and to finish the match spopovich tosses her out of the ring and he and yamu leave for the moment with videl badly injured goku goes to get some senzu beans from korin  
gohan is waiting anxiously for goku to return with the senzu beans finally the hero arrives and gohan takes a bean to videl who heals instantly gohan and kibito start their match but no punches are thrown kibito asks to see gohans super saiyan power and piccolo tells gohan to show him piccolo informs the others that shin is the supreme kai who then informs the z fighters not to intervene if anything happens to gohan gohan begins to power up  
gohan fully powers up and just as shin predicted spopovich and yamu suddenly attack him they stick a weird device inside him steal all of his energy and then leave shin takes off after them and goku piccolo krillin and vegeta follow kibito heals gohan and those two and videl also leave shin explains that long ago there was a wizard named bibidi who created a monster with unbelievable destructive power shin killed bibidi and the monster majin buu was left sealed in a ball now bibidis son babidi has come to resurrect the monster and they plan to use gohans stolen energy to do it  


 japan 
videl cant keep up with gohan and kibito kai so she decides to go back before she leaves she realizes that gohan was the kid who defeated cell and not her father and says that she will date him once he comes back they follow spopovich and yamu to babidis spaceship babidi comes out along with his new partner dabura the king of the demons after spopovich and yamu deliver the energy to babidi the wizard has no use for them and he kills both of them  
babidi enters the spaceship but dabura suddenly flies over to the z fighters and he kills kibito kai goku and vegeta take some shots at him but they miss dabura spits on krillin and piccolo turning them both to stone the only way to revive them is to kill dabura this lures the warriors into the ship upon arrival they meet babidis henchman pui pui who tells them that they must fight a different opponent on each level of the spaceship and as they are beaten up their energy will be absorbed by the room and injected into the ball that contains buu  
vegeta starts to beat up pui pui with no effort to give his fighter the advantage babidi changes the room to mimic pui puis home planet where the gravity is ten times that of earths unfortunately for pui pui vegeta trains at five hundred times of earths gravity and he easily destroys pui pui they move on to the second level where goku will fight babidis pet monster yakon  
goku and yakon start to fight goku is obviously stronger than yakon so babidi changes the environment to mimic the planet of darkness which is yakons home planet to help himself see goku becomes a super saiyan yakon the devourer of light sucks up the light emitting from goku seeing this goku again becomes a super saiyan allowing yakon to suck up all the light energy he can finally he becomes a super saiyan 2 and gives off a flash of brilliant energy which is too much for yakon to handle victorious the fighters head to the next level  
the fighters move to the third level this time its gohans turn to fight dabura decides that he will fight this time but first he goes to the meditation chamber to prepare meanwhile back at the world martial arts tournament only five fighters remain because the rest of them flew away hercule decides to finish the tournament with all five remaining fighters in the ring at the same time 18 takes out one of them and mighty mask composed of goten and trunks takes out another now its down to those two and hercule  
18 and mighty mask goten and trunks start to fight and because they are able to use their arms and legs simultaneously as mighty mask they have the upper hand against 18 but when she steps up the intensity they cant keep up with her so they decide to turn into super saiyans this of course blows their cover and they are disqualified now it is down to 18 and hercule meanwhile dabura has finally finished his meditation and is ready to fight gohan  
18 gets hercule in a headlock and she uses the opportunity to cut him a deal shell throw the match if he pays her double what he wins for the title he reluctantly agrees and the fight soon ends with hercule as the victor over in babidis spaceship dabura finally emerges ready to fight babidi sends them to a planet similar to earth so their fight wont damage the ship as their battle begins gohan finds that dabura is a tough opponent so he revs up his power to super saiyan level  
gohan and dabura continue fighting and from the outset it is clear that gohan has lost his edge he hasnt trained for seven years he was even stronger when he was a kid dabura is beating him fairly easily and vegeta starts to lose his cool noticing this dabura tells babidi to return them all to the ship he privately informs babidi that vegeta has a terrible rage burning inside him and that he could be made to serve their purposes meanwhile goten and trunks see videl flying back to the stadium and she tells them all about whats happening excited at the prospect of seeing magic and a wizard although they reveal that they dont even know what a wizard is they race off after the others  
goku gohan vegeta and the supreme kai are left wondering why dabura suddenly stopped the fight suddenly babidi tries to take over vegetas mind although he is urged to fight it babidis magic is too strong and vegetas impure heart gives in now with babidis m on his forehead he has turned evil babidi transports them all back to the world martial arts stadium where he instructs vegeta to kill his friends vegeta refuses as he apparently has not lost complete control of his mind he says that his only goal is to fight goku to bait goku into fighting him vegeta destroys part of the stadium killing many fans  
goku refuses to fight vegeta so vegeta destroys another part of the stadium to avoid any further casualties goku reluctantly agrees to fight the supreme kai tries to stop him but he sees that it is no use goku tells babidi to transport them far away from people and the wizard obliges the supreme kai and gohan decide to break into the next level of the ship and try and stop babidi to avoid this babidi commands vegeta to kill the supreme kai but vegeta refuses though babidi is possessing him vegeta can only focus on one thing fighting goku goku gives gohan one of the last two senzu beans before he and the supreme kai go further into the ship vegeta and goku power themselves up to their maximum level and are ready to fight  
goku and vegeta start to fight and their raw power is astounding both fighters possess incredible ability and so far the fight seems to be a draw vegeta is able to lock goku to a boulder with cuffs made of energy he tells goku how he has stolen his royal destiny by beating frieza and becoming a super saiyan first and how insulting it was to be surpassed in power by the child gohan goku is able to break free and the battle resumes with crushing force meanwhile gohan and the supreme kai have made it all the way to buus ball but babidi and dabura are waiting for them  
goku and vegeta continue their battle vegeta reveals that he knew he could never surpass gokus strength so he allowed himself to be taken over by babidi he had seen what it had done to spopovich and yamu and he wanted the power for himself he also says that he wanted babidi to reawaken the evil in his heart over the years he had become like a normal person he had a wife and a son and thought the earth was a nice place to live he wanted babidis magic to free him from those petty attachments but goku doesnt believe him meanwhile before gohan and the supreme kai can stop babidi buu has finally gathered enough energy and has begun to hatch  
in an attempt to abort the hatching gohan begins firing kamehameha waves at the ball but it doesnt seem to do much good the ball opens but after some pink steam escapes there is nothing left in the ball they believe that gohan destroyed buu with his energy blasts but suddenly the pink steam begins to congeal it forms into majin buu instead of a fearsome beast buu is a fat pink child but the supreme kai knows that it is really majin buu and not something else goku and vegeta have noticed the sudden upsurge in power and realize that buu has been hatched  
dabura insults majin buu and with a single blow buu dispatches with the king of the demons goku and vegeta feel buus surge of power and goku convinces vegeta to postpone the fight until they can take out buu vegeta says he doesnt want goku distracted while theyre fighting as goku is preparing to leave vegeta knocks him out with a blow to the head and takes the final senzu bean and promises to kill buu himself babidis first order to majin buu is to kill gohan and the supreme kai gohan grabs shin and takes off but even with their head start buu catches up to them with blinding speed with a single blow buu puts gohan out of commission leaving the supreme kai unguarded  
the supreme kai defends himself as best he can against buu but he is no match for him buu pounds the supreme kai into the ground and is preparing to eat him when gohan flies in and knocks buu away gohans recovery is short-lived because buu hits him with an energy blast of incredible power as gohan falls to the earth in a forest somewhere he is very badly injured goten and trunks arrive at the outskirts of the scene and notice the statues of piccolo and krillin trunks accidentally breaks the piccolo statue as buu is preparing to eat shin dabura suddenly throws a spear through him dabura warns babidi that he will soon lose control of buu and his monster will turn on him babidi doesnt believe him and now buus plans have changed dabura is next on the menu  
dabura tries his best to destroy buu but he is nowhere near strong enough to do the job buu turns him into a cookie and eats him with dabura gone krillin and piccolo despite his statue being slightly broken are able to come back to life just as buus about to eat the supreme kai vegeta makes his presence known by destroying babidis spaceship vegeta knows what buu did to gohan and he vows that when goku regains consciousness this will all be over even if it costs him his own life he promises to atone for what hes done and he powers up at full strength he ferociously attacks buu  
though incredibly powerful vegetas attacks do nothing to majin buu he even blasts a hole in the monster but buu is able to regenerate his body tired of playing around buu rocks the entire planet by powering up he then rips off part of his own belly and is able to wrap it around vegeta trapped the saiyan prince can do nothing to defend himself trunks cant stand to see his father tortured like this so he powers up and jets off to help him and goten follows  
trunks knocks buu away from his father and he and goten free vegeta from his bonds piccolo attacks babidi and despite the wizard using all of his magic to defend himself piccolo is able to slice him in half vegeta recovers and tells trunks that he is proud of him for the first time vegeta embraces his son he then knocks out goten and trunks allowing piccolo to carry them away to safety with buu back and ready for more vegeta makes the ultimate sacrifice he erupts in a blinding flash of light certainly killing anything near him including himself the last pure blood saiyan is now dead  
after vegetas eruption piccolo returns to the scene of the battle he finds no sign of vegeta left and that buu has been blasted into thousands of small pieces he also finds the top half of babidi who is begging for help suddenly the pieces of buu begin to reform they all combine to make majin buu whole again knowing hes outmatched piccolo retreats buu heals babidi and the two embark on a killing spree piccolo catches up with krillin telling him that the worlds last hope goten and trunks must be protected krillin is instructed to take the two young saiyans to dendes lookout meanwhile the suprem kai has recovered and is searching for gohan  
yamcha 18 bulma videl and chi chi among others go looking for the dragon balls their search for the seventh one leads them to a nest full of eggs but before bulma can grab it a dinosaur eats the entire nest yamcha hits the beast with an energy ball which causes it to fly into the ocean videl goes swimming after it and with a little help from master roshi they are able to extract the ball piccolo and krillin arrive at the lookout with the unconscious goten and trunks soon after goku regains consciousness and appears at the lookout himself  
while discussing tactics goku reveals that he knows of a method by which two similar-sized people can fuse together into one ultimate being they decide that goten and trunks will learn this new trick but the only problem is that it will take about a week to learn it and goku has less than a day left on earth piccolo decides to teach the boys after goku is gone suddenly the sky turns black and they realize that bulma is calling the dragon goku uses instant transmission to appear at capsule corp but she has already made one wish her wish was to bring back everyone that died today goku tells shenron that they will postpone their second wish and uses instant transmission to take everyone there back to the lookout with him meanwhile kibito kai awakens because of the wish and the supreme kai is still searching for gohan  
kibito kai finds the supreme kai and heals him then both of them find gohan and decide to take him to the world of the kais meanwhile back at the lookout goku breaks the news about vegeta and gohan to the everyone as both of them are believed to be dead as expected everyone is shocked chi-chi faints bulma screams for vegeta and videl cries and refuses to believe gohan is dead they are just about to wake trunks and goten when babidi suddenly starts a global announcement he tells everyone that he and majin buu will terrorize the entire planet until piccolo goten and trunks show themselves to give them a taste of whats in store he shows buu turning the entire population of a major city into small candies which he greedily consumes  
babidi tells the earth that anyone with any information about piccolo goten or trunks should tell him to stop any further damage piccolo wants to turn himself in but goku convinces him not to because he knows that even if the three turn themselves it it wont stop buus destruction goten and trunks wake up and they learn about vegeta and gohans supposed demise goku is harsh with them because they cant waste any time mourning right now the boys although angry at goku for not saving gohan and vegeta know that they must be tough to stop majin buu in the world of the kais kibito kai heals gohan and the supreme kai tells him about the z sword it is a mystical sword that contains great power and even the kais themselves could not pull it from the rock it is now stuck in the supreme kai believes that gohan possesses the strength to do so  
gohan attempts to free the z sword but cant do it in his normal state he transforms into a super saiyan and with a mighty heave he frees the sword from the rock to his great surprise the sword is incredibly heavy and he must now train himself to use it back on earth babidi and buu continue their reign of terror and goten and trunks tell him that theyre going to destroy him and buu  
goten and trunks begin their fusion training but it is soon interrupted by babidi he announces that he has learned where trunks lives and he and buu are now on their way to kill him goku sends trunks to get the dragon radar from capsule corporation before it is destroyed and he himself heads off to slow down buu and babidi he asks buu why he takes orders from someone as weak as babidi though buu seems intrigued by the thought of killing his master he dislikes goku as much as he does babidi so he decides to attack goku goku knows that an ascended super saiyan isnt enough to stop buu so he says hell take it up to the next level  
to buy as much time as possible goku demonstrates the super saiyan transformations he starts in his normal form then goes to super saiyan then super saiyan 2 he then transforms into super saiyan 3 and the immense power of this transformation rocks the entire planet his hair grows down to his knees and his eyes change his power is so incredible that gohan the supreme kai and kibito kai can feel it in the world of the kais as a super saiyan 3 he possesses even more power than majin buu he starts to pound buu with relative ease at capsule corporation trunks and dr brief frantically search for the dragon radar  
goku continues his awesome display of power but with each blow to majin buu the monster gets even more powerful he seems to have an unlimited well of energy to use bulma calls trunks on videls cell phone to tell him that she left the dragon radar in the airplane he retrieves the radar and heads back to the lookout goku senses this and decides to end his fight with buu he once again tells buu that hes much too skilled to be taking orders from babidi goku instantly transmits himself back to the lookout this time buu takes gokus advice and turns on his master he executes babidi meanwhile gohan continues his training with the z sword  
without babidi to control him majin buu goes on a spree of destruction trunks returns to the lookout with the dragon radar baba shows up to tell goku that he only has thirty minutes left his transformation into super saiyan 3 was very draining and it ate up a lot of his time that was left even though he is exhausted he begins teaching goten and trunks the fusion dance on the world of the kais gohan begins training with even more intensity than before determined to save the universe from majin buu  
buu clears some space in the countryside and builds a house for him to live in goten and trunks continue learning the fusion dance and begin to master the technique they each plead with goku for him to show them the super saiyan 3 transformation and because he knows his time is up goku complies soon after the transformation baba shows up to take him away goku says goodbye to everyone at the lookout once again he is gone  
back in other world goku visits king yemma to ask him if hes seen gohan king yemma says that gohan has not checked in thrilled that his son is still alive he searches for his energy signal and uses instant transmission to go there he starts to help gohan with his training with the z sword piccolo continues training goten and trunks to fuse buu happens upon a blind kid named tommy who doesnt seem to be scared of him buu restores the kids vision but to his surprise the child is not afraid of him he is grateful that buu made him see and considers buu a friend buu seems to like friendship more than fear  
goku throws a giant boulder at gohan to test his abilities with the z sword gohan makes a clean cut so the supreme kai conjures up a block of the hardest metal in the universe this time the sword cant cut it and breaks under the pressure but from out of the z sword comes the elder kai who is fifteen generations older than shin in exchange for a date with bulma the elder kai agrees to awaken gohans sleeping powers he starts to do a strange dance in circles around the saiyan and says that it will take 5 hours to awaken his sleeping power meanwhile goten and trunks have finally mastered the fusion dance and are ready to attempt it for real  
goten and trunks attempt to fuse and their first attempt yields a weird-looking fat kid with very little power their second attempt creates an old emaciated weakling finally the two are perfectly in sync and make gotenks piccolo tells him to wait thirty minutes for the fusion to wear off so they can try it as super saiyans gotenks thinks hes powerful enough already and takes off to find majin buu he is able to get some hits in on the monster but when buu steps up the intensity gotenks is no match and is easily defeated meanwhile on the world of the kais the elder kai continues the long ceremony needed to awaken gohans hidden power  
goten and trunks heal up from their injuries they will train the rest of the day and fight majin buu tomorrow at full strength on the world of the kais the elder kai has finished his five-hour ritual now gohan must sit and meditate for twenty more hours for his power to awaken back at buus house hercule arrives to defeat the evil creature he tries some tricks with poison candy and exploding video games but they have no effect on the monster buu decides to be friends with hercule  
goten and trunks successfully fuse as super saiyans but once again their ego takes over gotenks spends all of his time flying around the earth at full speed and by the time he decides to attack buu his 30 minutes are up back at buus house hercule is doing his best to please the monster he even cooks him dinner while away murdering people buu finds an injured dog and heals him buu discovers the joys of friendship with this dog and when hercule tells buu that killing is bad buu vows never to kill again but while buu and his pet are playing fetch two crazed gunmen shoot the dog

yusuke kuwabara and the masked fighter participate in a three-on-three battle with yen ryu and kai of team ichigaki as the members of this team are revealed to be humans they are unwittingly under the control of dr ichigaki after realizing this they essentially refuse to fight and team ichigaki gains the upper hand very quickly meanwhile kurama and hiei has to deal with two other members of team ichigaki who unleash the robot gatasval to attack the two  
the masked fighter saves yusuke and kuwabara from direct attacks by team ichigaki later revealed to be a young woman with pink hair yet her name is still unknown kurama and hiei defeats gatasval mentioning how dr ichigaki took command of yen ryu and kai using the blood-saver node as his invention the three shed tears of blood after kuwabara uses himself as a human shield to bear the combined attack of the three yusuke takes them all on and is able to sense and counter their attacks  
the masked fighter uses the spirit wave technique to remove the blood-saver node from their bodies thereby defeating them dr ichigaki transforms himself into a monstrous creature as a last resort to win the battle however he is quickly bested by an enraged yusuke due to the mechanics of the spirit wave technique it is realized that en ryu and kai are able to regain control of their bodies as they make their way back home team urameshi is forced to battle back-to-back with team mashotsukai a group of shadow channels much to their chagrin  
kuwabara is unable to fight due to the attack by team ichigaki ruka the nurse of the dark tournament is summoned to hold custody of hiei and the masked fighter creating a barrier around them and rendering them unable to escape due to their depleted spirit energy kurama is to face off against gama who uses paint to immobilize his opponent kurama unexpectedly uses his rose whip with his hair to severely wound gama gradually bleeding to death  
kuramas spirit energy is sealed by the dying efforts of gama as his paint was actually mixed with his blood kurama is to battle toya described as an ice master kurama breaks free of paralysis but is denied access to his spirit energy toya attacks kurama multiple times but is unable to target his vital points kurama defeats toya by implanting his plants into his own body to use as a weapon however falling unconscious  
bakken another member of team mashotsukai brutally assaults the comatose kurama nevertheless kuramas life is spared after noticing yusuke preparing to use his spirit gun in retaliation bakken uses his sweat glands to create a fog of mist in the ring attacking a blindsided yusuke it is apparent however that yusuke uses his spirit gun in order to clear the mist making the ring visible yusuke pushes bakken in the stomach for payback of his cruelty utterly damaging his thoracic cage and knocking him out of the ring jin the wind user of team masho then faces off against yusuke displaying the ability of flight  
jin uses his tornado fist to land a hit on yusuke who is literally blown away from the attack yusuke later counterattacks with a series of punches yet jin flies after being hit in the stomach yusuke then uses the spirit gun on him only to see jin create a whirlwind to deflect the blast when jin dives down from the sky using tornado fist a second time yusuke uses spirit gun again to cause a mass explosion however both are surprising still alive both contenders prepare for their ultimate attacks  
while jin has initiated a double tornado fist yusuke begins to use the spirit wave technique after disabling both fist yusuke catapults jin out of the ring overcoming him before yusuke is about to fight with the next opponent of team masho it has been realized that he has been disqualified by a technicality yukina arrives outside the stadium meeting up with botan keiko and shizuru kuwabara though still seriously injured volunteers himself to fight the last battle against risho the leader of the team  
risho easily inflicts further pain upon kuwabara he later unleashes his earth powers initially overwhelming kuwabara who is able to stand up to his feet and every critical hit kuwabara sees yukina in the audience who has arrived to gives him moral support in which he manages to overcome his injuries and defeats risho with his spirit sword  
the spirit beast of yusuke as his ordeal succeeding his death a year ago has hatched resembling that of a penguin now named pu team urameshi catches a glimpse of team toguro in the stadium the masker fighter takes yusuke into the forest to reveal herself to be genkai she begins the final step of training in order to perfect yusukes spirit gun  
yusuke is told that he must take genkais life in order to take her power though this was a test administered to see if yusuke cared about genkais death at all genkai creates a spirit wave orb and fuses it into yusukes body as a test of endurance meanwhile as the semifinal rounds begin the remaining members of team urameshi prepare to face off against team uraotogi in the first match hiei fights the ogreish fighter makintaro slicing off his left arm even when makintaro transforms his arm into an ax hiei effortlessly dispatches him  
yusuke struggles as he bears the pain of the spirit wave orb within him even when genkai attempts to remove it yusuke still chooses to handle the torture hiei is to battle kuro momotaro able to transform with apelike instincts making hieis techniques useless unable to use the dragon of the darkness flame lest it consume him in the process hiei is left with dwindling options  
as kuro momotaro then transforms with birdlike qualities hieis attacks are proven ineffective kuro momotaro later transforms with wolfish capabilities forcing hiei to use his powers in an unorthodox fashion by channeling the dragon of the darkness flame through his sword in order to dispatch kuro momotaro kurama is to fight the unwitting ura urashima as it is the rose whip versus the fishing pole whip in which a telepathic conversation between the two leads to deception of the former kurama is introduced to the idunn box reverting back to his demon form yoko kurama as the ring is covered in fog  
it is explained that kurama had gone into human form fifteen years past recovering his spirit energy from when he was a fox demon while yoko kurama grows a manlike tree having acidic saliva to melt its prey he interrogates ura urashima to discover the secret of the idun box however ura urashima is murdered by shishiwakamaru the leader of team uraotogi before he can reveal any information clearing the fog kuwabara is chosen to fight against shishiwakamaru after a game of rock-paper-scissors much to the dismay of kurama and hiei pu flies to yusuke inside the cave in order to nurture him with water to ease his ongoing pain soon overcame when yusuke smashes a boulder that was headed towards pu  
as kuwabara fights against shishiwakamaru with the spirit sword the latter quickly sends the former through the cape of no return transporting him outside of the ring kuwabara lands in another stadium meeting up with botan keiko shizuru and yukina shishiwakamaru then is to battle the masked fighter as to which genkai is shown now as elderly and not youthful from before the legality of the battle is called into question concerning the occurrence of disqualification after the match has been approved shishi wakamaru unsheathes his banshee shriek sword kuwabara botan keiko shizuru and yukina find yusuke and pu in the forest on their way to the semifinals stadium  
shishiwakamaru twirls his banshee shriek sword to resonance the shrill call of the reaper disturbing the ears of the audience moreover he dissipates the chorus of a thousand skulls from the sword and devours much of the audience kuwabara arrives as shishiwakamaru forms the cage of hell trapping genkai it is then that genkai turns the tables on shishiwakamaru by using her spirit reflection blast against his attack kuwabara must now face off against onji who appears to be just an old man  
keiko is almost attacked by demons in the forest but is saved by the appearance of chu rinku jin and toya they note that yusuke has become stronger onji creates the dimensional travel sphere and sends kuwabara back to the other stadium this elderly fighter then reveals himself to be the clownish suzuki as genkai is elected to fight him suzuki strives to be known as a god after first defeating genkai he whooshes his rainbow cyclone attack on an unharmed genkai who abruptly takes his rubber nose the two engage in hand-to-hand combat as suzuki demonstrates his body of steel muscle explosion technique yet despite this genkai easily defeats him  
three members of team toguro demonstrate their power on another team in the semifinals kuwabara watches over yusuke in the hotel room kurama spectates the fights and hiei goes to the seashore to improve his technique team toguro utterly slaughters this team with minimal effort genkai meets with the younger toguro in the forest mentioning a conflict between them from fifty years ago yusuke wakes up and runs into the forest after sensing the younger toguros immense spirit energy  
it is explained that genkai and the younger toguro were once a pair fifty years back however the younger toguro was greedy for eternal youth and ultimate strength the younger toguro confronts and battles a weakened genkai despite a final effort using her feeble energy genkai is overwhelmed by toguro and becomes mortally wounded as yusuke arrives giving yusuke her dying words she passes away and the younger toguro subsequently launches an enraged yusuke through the forest it is then that yusuke reminisces of when he trained under genkai mourning for her death  
suzuki encounters kuwabara and kurama giving them an elixir and a hilt respectively to enhance their natural abilities koenma finds yusuke in deep depression over genkai sakyo proposes to make a portal between the spirit world and the living world yusuke is motivated to prepare himself for the final round against team toguro  
team urameshi now with ameliorative spirit energies are ready for the final round begins with sakyo and koenma arriving to fill the vacancies on each of their teams the first match begins with kurama facing karasu  
karasus bomb abilities overwhelm kuramas plants just when all seemed grim kurama transforms into yoko kurama due to ingesting the fruit of previous life he received from suzuki before the fight attaining new and improved abilities yoko kuramas demon plants prove too much for karasu to handle  
kurasu loses his mask the only thing inhibiting his full power he unleashes a massive explosion seemingly killing yoko kurama and although he survived however the fruit of previous life reaches its time limit and yoko kurama reverts into his human form giving karasu the advantage in response kurama plays on karasus overconfidence and uses a desperate final attack to secure victory  
despite karasus death kurama loses the fight on a technicality hiei begins to fight bui able to deal with his immense ax attacks with little effort bui is later forced to remove his armor in order to effectively fight hiei  
in response to buis increased abilities hiei uses the dragon of the darkness flame although bui reflects the attacks back to hiei hiei absorbs the flames drastically increasing his physical abilities bui is later defeated in the process hiei goes into hibernation after having drained all his spirit energy  
a long intermission is called for replacing the ring after it was highly damaged kuwabara fights the elder toguro and grows incensed when he is the last to learn of genkais death however the elder toguros regenerative abilities makes kuwabaras attacks useless  
using the trial sword given to him by suzuki kuwabara manages to crush the elder toguro ensuring him the victory due to sakyo feeling that a fight with koenma would be meaningless he bets his life on victory of the younger toguro and koenma follows suit sakyo explains to the younger toguro how his gambling obsession first emerged despite the survival of the elder toguro who gloats over the wagers placed between the two fighters the younger toguro denied his assistance in the battle against yusuke and kicks him off the island  
rinko chu toya and jin come to watch the final match between yusuke and the younger toguro the fight becomes a standstill as both contestants prepare to attack yusuke shoots a massive spirit gun blast that sends the younger toguro out of the stadium however the younger toguro returns surprisingly uninjured by yusukes attack  
yusuke removes the spirit cuffs from the arms and legs chained to him by genkai unlocking the full power of his spirit energy even after yusuke inflicts a barrage of hits towards the younger toguro the latter remains uninjured the younger toguro presents one hundred percent of his total strength overwhelming yusuke  
yusuke is reminded of his childhood life with keiko when she cries out his name during the battle genkai possess pu and suggests the younger toguro to kill one of yusukes friends in order to increase his power exponentially the younger toguro choose kuwabara to die at his hands  
with kuwabara dead yusukes power rises with his grief in response toguro powers to one hundred and twenty percent of his total power as the two clash toguro manages to block the final blast of yusukes spirit gun but ends up crumbling down in defeat after its completion  
it is quite a shock that kuwabara is actually alive as his vital points were not damaged to fulfill his promise of defeat sakyo commits suicide by detonating the stadium with the participants and spectators barely able to escape destroying all his progress in his proposal keiko feeling catatonic is unresponsive to botans voice and yusuke later slaps her back to her senses the protagonists make it out alive at the last minute  
the protagonists prepare to sail home since the tournament has ended in the spirit world the younger toguro demands to go to the most brutal level of the underworld to repent for his deeds in life it is explained that the younger toguro had been psychologically scarred fifty years ago by a demon named kairin who killed all the students of his dojo genkai confront the younger toguro for blaming himself for his wrongdoings genkai is resurrected in the living world as the prize for winning the tournament  


japan

kuwabara and botan find gather kurama and hiei to aid them in rescuing yusuke although hiei is reluctant to do so botan convinces him to come with them the four head to the mansion where yusuke is held and find kaito in the first room kaito explains that they have entered a realm of four dimensions in which fantasy can be altered into reality hiei has been turned to stone after falling prey by one of kaitos attacks one that forbids from saying hot kuwabara is unable to snatch from yanagisawa the key to the room leading toward yusuke kurama has agreed to a game of taboo against kaito  
kuwabara and botan also turns into stone due to saying hot as well kurama discreetly takes the key from yanagisawa kurama challenges kaito to a game of taboo in which letters of the alphabet become taboo one by one over the course of the game waging their souls as their bids kurama surrounds himself with his manifested plants while kaito goes to the restroom emerging when only the first two letters are left kurama yells to scare him but he manages not to cry out it is until kurama makes silly faces at kaito that cause the latter to laugh thereby breaking the taboo kaito loses his own soul thus freeing the others  
yanagisawa shows kuwabara botan kurama and hiei to four aberrant stairways that will lead to yusuke yanagisawa disguises himself as one of the four forcing yusuke to determine who is the impostor unable to figure out who actually is the fraud yusuke manages to use his intuition to successfully identify that kuwabara has been impersonated it is revealed that genkai orchestrated this test of perception in which the mind will be needed as much as the body  
genkai informs that a breach within the city is carving a tunnel toward the demon world causing humans to experience supernatural powers koenma further explains that violent apparitions with chaotically flood the streets and the tunnel will soon be opened only b-class demons will be able to pass the tunnel while the s-class and a-class demons will be repelled by the barrier the protagonists are given three weeks to seek and destroy the ones responsible for the breach  
yusuke genkai kido and yanagisawa go to a local bar only to find murota another psychic human with the ability to tap into peoples minds in an attempt to recruit him yusuke challenges murota to a boxing match easily defeating him murota agrees to assist the four in finding the person causing the breach murota is sent to the hospital after being injured due to a pencil eraser shot by kaname sniper hagiri he then finds out that seven people are responsible for the breach  
yanagisawa and murota have been incapacitated due to viral insects released by minoru doctor kamiya kido later has his spinal cord severed by doctors psychic scalpel yusuke arrives when a group of doctors surround kido yusuke is able to determine doctors identity after kido uses his shadow to write his name yusuke chases after doctor recognizes his talents of cutting and stitching  
for their concern over yusuke and kuwabara keiko yukimura and shizuru kuwabara go to the hospital albeit the former becomes poisoned by a viral insect yusuke battles doctor and is forced to come to a decision whether to kill him to save the people in the hospital kuwabara botan kurama and kaito make it to the hospital alert of the situation kurama finds keiko and shizuru in the elevator ultimately yusuke blasts doctor outside of his territory rendering him unconscious and resolving the situation  
koenma updates yusuke kuwabara and botan that the breach will occur in one week due to its spherical shape yusuke and kuwabara part ways after the latter decides to attend a concert with his friends meanwhile kurama goes to see koenma as he suspects that koenma may already know the identity of who is behind the plot to destroy the barrier kuwabara and his friends are soon attacked by kiyoshi seaman mitarai while seaman traps kuwabaras friends inside his aquatic creature kuwabaras inability to use his powers force him into a critical situation  
the dormant powers of kuwabara have awaken as he continues his fight against seaman seaman realizes that kuwabara is the one that can shatter barriers between different dimensions using his new spirit sword kuwabara frees his friends and defeats seaman kuwabara brings his friends along with seaman back to his home seaman talks about a video called chapter black showing footage of victims of humankinds atrocities against their fellow men viewing of this footage can change a human against its own kind shinobu black angel sensui is revealed to be a former spirit detective unveiled as the mastermind behind the plot to remove the barrier to the demon world  
sensui being able to sense and destroy apparitions was responsible for sealing up a smaller tunnel to the demon world in which only lower class demons were allowed through sakyo sold these demons in his black market acquiring millions of dollars in profit sensui witnesses humans practicing sacrificial rituals on demons causing him to insanely murder the humans for their cruelty therefore the breach will serve as atonement for the sin of the human race sensui and sniper make their appearance launching an attack on seaman indicating that there is only two days preceding the breach it is up to yusuke kuwabara and kurama to stop sensui  
yusuke battles sensui in the streets being overwhelmed by his moves elsewhere botan and seaman are dealt with sniper who is constantly firing small objects of which shizuru is badly injured by a diverted attack orchestrated by sensui yusuke kuwabara and kurama chase sensui inside a building fighting against him one by one only to be equally matched sensui leaves as sniper arrives devising a scheme to kidnap kuwabara  
sensui travels away while yusuke is forced to contend with sniper genkai arrives to heal wounds of botan and shizuru sniper eventually marks yusuke with targets enabling his projectiles to be sent without him even having to aim koenma and genkai are informed by seaman of kurabaras potential ability to shatter barriers sniper sends hundreds of rock projectiles at yusuke with pinpoint accuracy putting the latter in a dangerous situation  
sniper continues his battle against yusuke using a semi-trailer truck as a projectile and is nearly victorious until hiei arrives in a swing of his sword hiei incapacitates him hiei later fights yusuke only to prove the point the motivation that harnesses spirit energy hiei decides to join in the group in an attempt to stop sensui  
seaman leads yusuke kurama hiei genkai kaito and yanagisawa to the breach hideout where they face tsukihito gamemaster amanuma a young boy and a stellar gamer whose territory lets him bring any video game to life the seven must participate in a video game testing seven areas of skills seaman is to play in a tennis match in the first round becoming triumphant in the end  
genkai plays battleship target game easily winning the round yusuke plays in a fighting tournament eventually becoming the victor gamemaster decides to play against kaito in a trivial pursuit kaito is handily defeated when gamemaster answers each question before they are displayed  
kurama and gamemaster play a variation of tetris kurama reveals to gamemaster that he will die if he loses the game this emotional control and intimidation result in gamemaster forfeiting the game and his life in the process koenma tells botan that he will remove his pacifier to prevent the breach yusuke kurama hiei and seaman arrive at sensuis lair seeing kuwabara held hostage and the breach nearly opened  
kurama still torn over the outcome of the gamemaster attacks sadao gourmet makihara who is responsible for consuming murota gourmet is revealed to have been taken over by the elder toguro in which kurama traps him within the sinning tree forcing him to hallucinate his worst fear for all eternity kuwabara is no longer held captive  
while kuwabara kurama hiei and seaman are placed into another dimension by gatekeeper itsuki yusuke must face sensui alone itsuki explains to the four of his first encounter with sensui recognizing him for his affection it is apparent that sensuis experience and long-trained abilities as a spirit detective put yusuke at a disadvantage  
sensui repeatedly launches his splinter resshūken sending blasts of energy spheres at yusuke koenma journeys his way toward sensuis lair as yusuke manages to gain the advantage through sheer determination sensui switches personalities to kazuya a merciless killer itsuki construes that sensui has dissociative identity disorder having seven split personalities that had emerged from the traumatic encounter with humans who had sacrificed demons in his past as yusuke is about to lose his life from the trigger of the gun koenma appears just in the nick of time  
koenma threatens sensui with his wicked seal conscience ring a defensive spell in his pacifier that can trap even s-class demons yusuke stops koenma before he attacks and handily defeats kazuya shinobu the primary personality takes control of sensuis body  
sensui reveals his sacred energy which places him on par with s-class demons to stop him koenma releases the wicked seal conscience ring but sensuis power enables him to destroy it making the situation seem hopeless  
yusuke fares poorly against sensuis sacred energy while his allies desperately attempt to break through itsukis dimension kuwabara manages to do so with his dimension sword reminiscing of his times with yusuke however before kuwabara can get to him yusuke is struck down by sensui  
kuwabara kurama and hiei increase their power and pursue sensui through the breach incensed by the death of yusuke kurama transforms into yoko kurama as hiei releases the dragon of the darkness flame since kurama and hiei only have demon energy they are unable to pass the barrier unlike sensui who possesses sacred energy kuwabara slices through the barrier between worlds to pursue sensui into the demon world though they have him outnumbered they prove to be outmatched against sensuis attacks  
the spirit defense force is dispatched from the spirit world to seal the breach they are also ordered to terminate yusuke for he is a genetically inherited half-demon however yusuke discovers his half-demon nature and awakens pu is transported to the lair and transformed into a phoenix yusuke and koenma enter into the breach making their way toward sensui  
a newly-revived yusuke resumes his battle with sensui kuwabara kurama hiei and koenma watch as yusuke collides with sensui demon energy versus sacred energy nonetheless yusukes body is taken over by a mysterious force fully awakening his demon side  
yusukes enhanced powers easily enable him to overcome sensui much to his surprise itsuki arrives and tells the group that sensui was plagued with an internal disease only having a month left to live it is revealed that koenma had used his wicked seal conscience ring to resurrect gamemaster sensui clarify the reason for opening a tunnel to the demon world for which it is his grave as well as his repentance itsuki takes sensuis body into his dimension in solitude and peace

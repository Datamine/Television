thus they head to baratie which actually is pretty much right next to where they were they then get passed by fullbodys marine ship fullbody doesnt recognize the straw hat pirates mark but he recognizes johnny and yosaku as worthless pirate hunters johnny responds by shouting this is what pirate hunters do while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air nami takes note of the arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chiefs room in baratie where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year

sanji on the other hand heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal fullbody in the meantime leaves the restaurant sneakily along with the subordinate who got shot earlier guess he is still alive sanji brings his meal to the pirate who was thrown out by patty sanji states that for him a customer is anybody who is hungry he also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else the pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life luffy who was watching the whole thing attempts to recruit sanji as the cook for his crew after refusing and some conversing we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame luffy as always is stubborn and insists that sanji joins them we also find out that the other pirates name is gin meanwhile in the kitchen we learn that don krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships gin thanks sanji for the meal and leaves sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that sanji is giving out food for free which makes gin even more grateful 
luffy is then sent back to work where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen the rest of the crew zoro nami and usopp turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant sanji after seeing nami is captivated by her beauty while flirting with nami the head chef tells sanji that hes annoying and that he doesnt need him anymore meanwhile gin informs don krieg of the restaurant where don krieg makes clear his intention to visit the restaurant  
ghin returns to the baratie with his captain don krieg on a nearly destroyed ship and begs the cooks to feed him sanji feeds him again despite knowing that he is evil but krieg betrays him and demands 100 meals for his men as well as the restaurant ship the cooks oppose sanji but zeff agrees to prepare the food

problems with yggdrasil the computer system focused on belldandy start to cause serious disruption on earth belldandys younger sister skuld arrives to fix the system force and take belldandy back to heaven the goddesses hunt down the software bugs while skuld attempts to persuade belldandy as the software bugs continue to disrupt keiichis life belldandy agrees to return to heaven after telling keiichi that time travels differently there and that one second in heaven could equal hundreds of years on earth keiichi promises to wait for her return no matter what although skuld is pleased initially she comes to realize the extent of keiichi and belldandys dedication to one another with keiichis help she rebuilds her bug stomper and with the bugs finally eliminated skuld announces her intention to remain on earth to watch over the pair  
skuld is having a hard time adapting to life on earth and her attempts to help belldandy around the temple are not as successful as she would like when megumi turns up and criticizes skulds work on keiichis bike both megumi and skuld decide to enter separate robots into a competition megumi embraces the help of others but skuld turns down all offers of assistance both contestants manage to produce their robots but on the day of the contest it becomes clear that skulds emphasis on power over control has given the advantage to megumi skuld attacks megumis creation with her own but megumi is able to stop her in desperation skuld causes her robot to self-destruct destroying megumis robot in the process however belldandy skuld and megumi manage to settle their differences and agree to work together next time  
in the hope of attracting more attention from her sister skuld builds banpei-kun rx when mara arrives banpei drives her away thus proving its worth unfortunately banpei consumes considerable power thus causing disruption to keiichis work and urds entertainment skuld responds by modifying banpei to be more power efficient things continue to go awry when banpei attacks keiichi believing that it is defending belldandy although it was never programmed to behave in that way banpei has modified its own programming because of its love for belldandy banpei constantly follows belldandy around learning to accept the others only as a result of belldandys teachings and example when mara returns skuld and banpei work together to rescue belldandys lunch but banpei loses its memory and personality when saving skuld  
mara takes possession of megumi and summons senbee the god of unhappiness and poverty in the hope of separating keiichi and belldandy the earth spirit who shares megumis apartment does his best to help her but fails and is forced to make his way to belldandy disguised as a teddy bear meanwhile mara and senbee try to bring misfortune on keiichi but keiichi seems to be having a very lucky day and each attempt is deflected by a corresponding stroke of good fortune things come to a head when mara seals belldandys powers and senbee causes the car keiichi is driving to burst into flames with the arrival of the earth spirit to explain events belldandy is able to exorcise mara from megumi and to use her powers to save keiichi  
sora lacking in self confidence is entered into a women-only go-kart race she initially refuses to participate but belldandy persuades her sora moves in with the others at the temple and skuld builds a race track for her to practice on skuld also builds a robot to drive the kart for sora and urd tries to transform soras personality with one of her potions but both schemes are unsuccessful with sora about to give up belldandy convinces her to try one last time sora finally succeeds but on the day of the race she falls ill brought on by her fear of failure eventually following keiichis example and with some wise words from belldandy sora is able to compete in the race  
megumi arranges a seaside vacation for keiichi and belldandy as an opportunity for keiichi to get closer to belldandy but skuld and urd tag along as well urd wishes to be helpful but her assistance is more of a hindrance than a help skuld though still wanting belldandy to have nothing to do with keiichi constantly interferes after urd tells keiichi that he must declare his love to belldandy he tries to do just that near the sea but skuld interferes with a robot and almost destroys everything belldandy saves keiichi but just as he declares his love skuld comes between the pair leading keiichi and skuld to believe that they are the ones destined to be together in spite of their wishes belldandy however is happy that keiichi has finally revealed his feelings for her  
urd prepares an aphrodisiac which skuld sabotages by adding extra ingredients although the potion created in the form of small sweets was intended for keiichi belldandy eats it instead and becomes far more outgoing when urd realizes what has happened she reveals to skuld that an antidote is possible but it would take thirty hours to make and the potion will wear off in twenty-four hours anyway keiichi finds it difficult to cope with belldandys new personality but he agrees to take her out shopping skuld and urd follow trying to keep things under control as keiichi continues to be confused by belldandys behavior unsure of how he should react as the day ends keiichi and belldandy travel along the coast at sunset ending up in an old church where belldandy professes her love and keiichi professes his in return  
urd and skuld are called back to heaven because of increasing problems with the yggdrasil however skuld leaves keiichi a dessert which changes him into a woman belldandy while trying to prepare an antidote for keiichi is exposed to a virus from heaven and becomes ill on skulds suggestion megumi sora toraichi and otaki pay a visit forcing keiichi to disguise himself until they leave although megumi sees through the act and assumes it must be to help belldandy in desperation keiichi resorts to dialing wrong numbers in the hope of reaching the goddess helpline but all to no avail when belldandys angel holy bell emerges with crystals marring her skin keiichi makes one more attempt to contact the goddess helpline and succeeds following urds instruction keiichi climbs the tokyo tower to catch wind crystals for the cure on skulds advice they jump from the tower and are saved only by banpeis efforts returning to the temple urd makes up the antidote which keiichi then administers to belldandy via a kiss  
skuld begins training in magic so that she may have an angel just like belldandy however she becomes frustrated by the amount of effort involved and so tries to shortcut the process through science building a device to amplify her powers when she switches it on it casts a high-level water spell knocking skuld unconscious and trapping her with keiichi belldandy is unable to reach them as her powers are insufficient only urd is powerful enough if she summons her angel but she cannot as she ordered it never to appear again because of its hybrid demon/goddess appearance finally urd comes to terms with her angel and summons it to save skuld the episode ends with a call from the almighty one who reveals that urds license has been suspended  
marller finds and awakens the lord of terror who has been sealed in an urn to bring misery to the world urd depressed over the loss of her goddess license tries to cope by finding something to do with her life but everything she tries only makes her feel worse after the lord of terror offers her a chance to regain her powers by embracing her demonic side he takes possession of her and urd announces that she is the lord of terrors rightful heir belldandy is thus given a choice either to inform the almighty one who may destroy urd or to try to save urd by herself making things more difficult urd now possesses the ultimate destruction program and unless the goddesses can stop her she will destroy the world when urd arrives accompanied by a giant robot belldandy skuld and keiichi engage her in battle although urd is temporarily defeated thanks to their efforts mara ambushes them sealing keiichi away when he tries to protect belldandy once belldandy has recovered she realizes that the only way she can defeat urd is by removing her own power limiter thus unleashing her full strength  
belldandy in search of sufficient power to stop the lord of terror releases her full strength and buys the goddesses time to resolve the emergency meanwhile urd starts to unleash the ultimate destruction program by working through each level of protection belldandy finds her and attempts to destroy the urn in which the lord of terror was confined inadvertedly removing the final layer of protection this starts the destruction program and releases fenrir the almighty one contacts skuld and sends her the vaccine for the program and belldandy does battle with urd once more during the battle however the lord of terror leaves urd to possess fenrir skuld arrives and belldandy blows the flute of midgard being the cure for the ultimate destruction program thus summoning midgard the lord of terror is seemingly defeated but at the last minute he manages to take possession of midgard  
the lord of terror now possessing midgard continues his attack as he attempts to open a gate to the world of the demons keiichi and skuld manage to work out what is happening and belldandy deletes midgard injuring keiichi in the process confident that the lord of terror is gone the three goddesses and keiichi head back to the now destroyed temple unaware that the lord of terror has taken possession of keiichi he takes the flute of midgard and leaves belldandy with the option of killing him or allowing the earth to be destroyed furthermore the valkyrie lind descends with orders to kill the lord of terror and keiichi in the process if necessary belldandy chooses to defend keiichi even at the cost of her own life the lord of terror threatens to kill keiichi in an attempt to force the goddesses to assist him in his aims prompting belldandy to offer herself in keiichis place however when the lord of terror discovers that he cannot possess a goddess skuld takes advantage of his weakness to force him into a floppy disc instead which she wipes with a magnet thus defeating him  
problems at yggdrasil after the lord of terror incident result in belldandy shrinking and urd becoming a child urd spends her temporary childhood with a new friend shohei yoshida after almost getting him into trouble when she was caught drinking sake meanwhile keiichi and belldandy work on producing moon rocks in an effort to provide an alternative energy source for the goddesses while yggdrasil is being repaired urd decides to help shohei increase in self-confidence and takes him to the top of a high-rise construction site as a test for him to overcome his fear with the moon rocks complete and urd once again her normal age she says goodbye to shohei pretending to be his friends older sister she agrees to see him again once he has grown up

master shake pretends to fall down a well in an attempt to pick up girls his roommate in the well is dirtfoot a combination of bigfoot and the jersey devil 
 
in this episode frylock becomes angry when he sees that the aqua teens have an electric bill for 2600 he finds out that shake caused the high fee by charging an anthropomorphic oversized cell phone that he got from boost mobile in exchange for advertising the company which he does whenever the camera is on him 
he gets a call from his friend josh who he alleges served in the army with him a thousand years ago josh is presented as a live action photograph as the episode progresses shake reveals that josh threatened to castrate him if he lost the phone which annoys frylock with its chirping frylock asks meatwad what he wants to do and he replies that he wants to find out how cows are milked shake tells frylock that milking a cow isnt very urban and he tells frylock that he sounds black shake and the phone want to come with them and frylock takes them all three thousand miles below the earths surface where the phone explodes when meatwad asks frylock where the farm is frylock replies that a cow would melt under these conditions and then that he already took him to the farm 
the aqua teens return to find two phones in place of the one frylock killed frylock brings them outside where they fall into a hole that also leads underground and meatwad seals it with a boulder the land line rings and shakes afraid to answer it but meatwad answers and its josh who again threatens to castrate shake 
when shake hangs up he criticizes advertising boost mobile and many phones appear using molecular transporters and downloadable switchblades they swarm shake and proceed to castrate and/or kill him a can of axe body spray asks frylock if he is the milkshake guy and meatwad tells him that hes in the house getting his ass whupped meatwad asks the can if he camn get him something and the can replies no im good im in the credits which he is appearing in almost every shot 
 
in this episode shake and meatwad show some scenes from untitled master shake project shake claims that the movie has no plot and that viewers were disgusted when they saw it at the mall of america 
the clips revolve around the insane-o-flex exercise machine &amp its motherboard first carl shows off his hypno-rims which are as frylock points out designed to spin at the frequency of the female brain wave allowing carl to rape anyone he wants the mooninites steal them from him so they can mock the plutonians &amp the ghost the latter of whom seem to be working together later the mooninites hypnotize carl with his own rims telling him to pull down his pants to stick a broom up his ass and to steal the motherboard carl sticks the broom through his whole body to the point where it bulges at the top of his head 
he also disturbs bees causing them to swarm around him he shows up at the aqua teens house wanting to use the insane-o-flex frylock tells him how about taking that broom out of your ass first to which carl tells him that he likes the broom there frylock struggles to put the motherboard into the insane-o-flex but it wont fit as its a completely different font carl pretends to help him but steals the motherboard instead 
carl brings the motherboard to the mooninites plutonians and ghost who are now working together he tells them that it dont fit and the ghost goes directly in front of the camera yelling impossible meatwad shows his video meatwads disco safari party explosion” which shake blows up during the credits 
part 2 of this episode was in the same 30min time slot as part 1 on the volume 5 dvd its presented as a different episode carl comes to where shakes showing his movie with the broom still up his ass shake shows the rest of his movie the aqua teens go to carls house &amp find the mooninites plutonians &amp ghost there carl tells frylock that they used the hypno-rims to force him to rape himself with the broom so frylock uses the rims on them &amp forces them to give him the motherboard the aqua teens and carl go to the aqua teens house where carl has recovered he tells them that he mentally lost at least 2 days meatwad pulls the broom out of his ass quickly after the movie ends carl is confused as to why the brooms still in his ass when he saw that meatwad pulled it out shake dodges the question completely and carl walks away he returns with a shotgun without the broom in his ass implying that he removed it himself this time meatwad shows the rest of his movie while carl kills shake in the background 
 
carl and the aqua teens walk out of a restaurant called wong burger” they hear about a new promotion rip-n-win” where you rip the bottom off of your cups and get a prize while shake and meatwad both get a coupon for wasabi fries carl reads from his tonight you will get your dick ripped off” 
later the gang watches a tv commercial with a quick disclaimer say some customers may get their dicks ripped off which since the disclaimer was fast meatwad acts out with two puppets facing the prize of genital mutilation carl hides in the aqua teens house eventually a couple of chinese-looking large grains of rice with necklaces made of penises come to the athfs house and they tell them carl isnt there unsure the two search the house causing carl to hide eventually they give up and report this to mr wongburger a life-sized anthropomorphic penis who wants the penises to build a rocket ship to go back to his home planet 
later on frylock performs plastic surgery on carl to prevent him from getting his dick ripped off unfortunately frylock accidentally removed carls penis in the process throwing it in the garbage can the two of mr wongburgers men steal it and drive off 
however the aqua teens sneak over to mr wongburgers laboratory and confront him but he explains that he wants to go back to his home world they try stopping him to no avail in the end the spaceship fails to launch and carls penis is saved albeit frylock added a third testicle and then shake digs in the trash and eats a hotdog between 2 soggy walnuts” 
 
frylock genetically engineers a dog for meatwad using the make your own dog 10 software carls pool and master shakes hand dna meatwad names the dog handbanana” handbanana can speak so that his words are heard only by carl who is immediately unnerved by handbananas clearly menacing but initially-mysterious threat tonight you since handbananas speech cannot be heard by frylock master shake or meatwad—to them handbanana plays the guileless capering pup—carl appears either hallucinatory or simply deranged for the majority of the episode handbanana carries out his threats and brutally rapes carl whenever they are alone several times during the show 
carl creates his own genetically engineered dog he names it the enforcer” though it prefers the name spaghetti” he orders spaghetti to rape handbanana but spaghetti does not find himself attracted to handbanana and instead brutally gang rapes carl along with handbanana it turns out later in the episode that the software make your own dog 10 is illegal in most nations and has adverse side-effects such as the dog forming a mental link with members of the owners family in this case it is carl which is why only he can hear handbananas threats  
the episode ends with master shake and frylock looking out the window and watching spaghetti and handbanana brutally make love to carl frylock goes to lock the doors and leaves master shake alone master shake then begins to move up and down giving the illusion that he is masturbating frylocks voice can be heard saying no one wants to see that shake go to your room to which master shake replies i dont have a room 
 
master shake attempts to learn electric guitar from a video tutorial but is easily outdone by meatwad who plays a metal riff flawlessly meatwad points out that shakes small hands make it hard for him to play so shake deliberately agitates a beehive in order to swell his hands 
meanwhile frylock is working on creating a time machine but shake and meatwad seem more concerned about a protrusion on his face frylock sees a doctor thinking it to just be a simple skin irritation but after testing the doctor reveals that frylock has cancer as the episode goes on frylock appears more and more sick and has fewer and fewer fries shake meatwad and carl try to cheer him up by throwing him a party with andrew wk performing but frylock just wants to rest 
the three are very concerned and shake comes up with an idea involving the time machine he proceeds to destroy it and burn it hoping the fumes will smoke the cancer out but burns down the house frylock tells them he cannot be out in the sun so he goes to live with carl temporarily who is concerned about whether he can get his disease or not shake straps himself to a rocket hoping to blow up the sun for frylock but the rocket explodes killing him 
later frylock returns to the doctor for further test results and he discovers the latest tests were negative the doctor however claims that aliens have landed and that they must band together to stop them just as they arrive and start destroying the office this all turns out to be a dream of frylocks and he awakes at the doctors who tells him the tests were negative and he should be fine 
 
meatwad and master shake call frylock late at night having been thrown in jail for a dui while driving carls car the next morning carl discovers his car missing finds a post-it note on the curb saying thanks for car ms” and tries to peddle shoddy giants uniforms he commissioned to be made to frylock later in carls room bart oates appears much to carls excitement carl recounts his stats and the many games of oates he watched then reveals how he had hoped oates would become injured after he transferred to the 49ers oates reveals that it was because of this that he had to get knee surgery and retire bart reappears several more times giving carl advice on how to be a better person and improve his life he tutors him on being polite to frylock convinces him to bail shake and meatwad out of jail and forces him to apologize to the grave of an elderly man he ran over and to the band chicago who he swindled by selling counterfeit chicago shirts they werent even good counterfeits as they said chicano instead of chicago oates finally leads carl to linda hamiltons house and instructs carl to kill her so she wont give birth to john connor who will lead the resistance to the rise of the machines bart claims hes been sent by them and reveals how when he got his surgery he was implanted with computers bart rips apart his skin revealing his insides and carl notes that most of his interior work is just old garbage a discovery that dismays bart oates alarms go off at the house and carl flees 
sometime later frylock picks a bb pellet out of carls brain wondering how it got there in a flashback we see that bart oates convinced shake to shoot carl from outside his house 
 
as the show begins master shake is spitting mucus into a kiddie pool so that meatwad can make a sculpture out of it which he affectionately names mucus man frylock yells at them but rather than trying to get them to stop their slimy activity he convinces the pair they need to heat up the mucus on a grill in order to be able to mold it correctly he tries to set them up with a harmless environmentally friendly grill made of wood but master shake instead buys the char-nobyl 6000 an illegally imported barbecue grill with a nuclear core made of radioactive waste from chernobyl shake forgets to turn off the grill which sets clouds on fire disintegrates the ozone layer melts the polar ice caps and floods new jersey suddenly mucus man who has been brought to life by the radioactivity appears and asks who owns the grill frylock points the fry at shake who in turn blames meatwad mucus man thanks meatwad for creating the perfect environment for him to survive -- and take over your dumbass planet 
twelve years later the mucus creatures have enslaved the world they constantly whip frylock shake and carl into spitting up phlegm meatwad rules as their ruthless king even having carl congested executed by his mucus minions however at this point we are brought back to the beginning of the episode as frylock explains about the grill and we realize that shake actually just daydreamed the whole story the show ends with shake giving a speech in which he implores the american people to stop global warming you must eat your boogers america 
 
the show opens with master shake and meatwad sitting around reminiscing about past events they eventually stray off topic into more extravagant tales like how hugh hefner invited shake to the playboy mansion concerned on how there were too few guys frylock reminds the two of how many times hes saved their lives accompanied by a clip montage mostly of him doing just that from past episodes accompanied by andrew wks song from party all the time shake tries to counter this by talking about how he picked out frylocks computer for him but fails to mention how he ran off to mexico when the bill arrived meatwad adds his own story about his first pubic hair which he found in his food at a restaurant and has been collecting them ever since and presents a shirt he presents it to frylock who suggests that carl may want it more during the phone call frylock coaxes carl over when he finds porn star tera patrick is inexplicably at their house what they dont mention is the shadowy grim reaper-like figure out in front of their door holding a line of gutter as carl approaches the house the reaper identifies himself as dan from grim reaper gutters and tries to sell him a gutter plan and tells him the company slogan that they wont leave without a sale after carls insistent refusal dan touches him with his skeletal hand and he drops dead this doesnt draw him from the aqua teens house however so frylock is forced to buy something the biggest plan they have after meatwad misunderstands a joke from shake to tera show us a bridge in new york he takes out a gun and commits suicide rated tv-ma 
 
as the episode begins frylock and meatwad are playing checkers in the aqua teens living room master shake enters and announces he has bad glaucoma and that his doctor said he needs to smoke marijuana to help him get better the mooninites arrive and say they grow marijuana on the moon called moonajuana at first to battle their own crippling illnesses but now simply for recreation against frylocks wishes shake and meatwad go off with ignignokt and err to get stoned 
rather than actually smoking cannabis the mooninites set fire to a pile of tires and wood in the driveway then lower a clear chamber shaped just like ignignokt over it holding in all the fumes claiming they are already very high the mooninites stay outside and watch as the typically clueless shake and meatwad stay inside the hood and get high act silly and eventually pass out this part of the plan accomplished they go to burgle the aqua teens house but are thwarted by frylock they then try their luck with carl asking if he would like to get high but he says that hed only do it if someone gave it to him the mooninites claim frylock has drugs and while carl is distracted break into his house however they are not interested in stealing carls possessions which mainly consist of new york giants memorabilia and pornography and thus decide to burn his house to the ground so no one else can have it 
carl fondly remembering his high school days of getting lit and listening to styx” joins shake and meatwad under the hood while the mooninites continue to try to trick frylock frylock grows tired and asks why they are always bothering the aqua teens considering there are so many other people on planet earth the mooninites claim they were never taught that there were so many people as they didnt have fathers growing up err gives a speech about how his parents left him and how he just steals to get attention hearing this frylock suggests that if they want attention they should go to los angeles and try out to be movie stars they take the advice and leave 
following this the aqua teens are seen watching a television drama featuring err as an extra playing a gay prostitute a man with questionable intent then approaches err and several other gay prostitutes shortly before opening fire on the group with an uzi 
 
a small milkshake looking just like master shake arrives at the aqua teens house calling shake daddy shake is very resistant to him claiming there is no proof that he can be his son frylock too doubts he could be shakes son since shake has no genitalia shake berates the small milkshake who runs off crying then threatens to take a bus to reno frylock and meatwad however like the little shake and decide to let him stay with them meatwad names him jesus ezekial jesus 
they play in carls pool where shake tries to drown ezekial by dropping a cinder block on him shake claims he did it since they cant afford college for him but frylock says that nobody is going to college and that he will work security at the mall when he gets older shake demands that ezekial be a professional basketball star when he grows up so they all go to a court and play during the game ezekial tries to make a far shot but misses they later begin playing a game of tennis in which shake plays badly and blames ezekial shake leaves in a huff and sits in carls car with the exhaust routed into it in an attempt to kill himself carl witnesses this and pulls him out not wanting his car to be ruined or to waste costly gasoline 
meatwad brings shake in the house to witness ezekial match wits with the chess dragon ezekial wins and the dragon leaves angrily meatwad congratulates him claiming no ones ever beaten the chess dragon shake says hes now proud to call ezekial his son but frylock claims thats impossible knowing hes never had sex frylock also says hes done a dna test showing ezekial is older than shake is ezekial states that he is 4000 years old shake does not believe there can be two talking milkshakes” the chess dragon then bursts through the roof and snatches ezekial who exclaims that he is going on an adventure frylock says well there were two talking milkshakes 
 
after two aliens build a large antenna attached to carls house carl and the aqua teens are enticed into watching the show the aliens broadcast - a show wherein the aliens do nothing but move the same boxes back and forth - despite their swelling heads and constant nosebleeds 
george lowe as himself 
 
meatwad responds to an ad in the newspaper and gets a job at carls car wash standing out on the highway in front of it waving and dancing to attract business but only gets cups full of coke thrown at him the proprietors of the business a large floating human-like brain named carl and his son carl jr who talks in quick gibberish feel their business is failing since meatwad can only shape shift into a hot dog or an igloo meatwad gets some help from frylock in trying some new shapes but eventually gives up he instead takes master shakes advice and tries unsuccessfully to antagonize their neighbor carl into getting his car washed by turning into a fist extending his middle finger then asking if he is a dumbass whos gonna get his ass whupped only when shake completely covers carls car with dirt does he take it to the car wash this a rare instance of shake helping meatwad without an ulterior motive or for personal gain except perhaps the joy he gets from tormenting carl 
at the car wash meatwad has him lie down on a gurney with an oxygen mask as they both watch his car go through the wash first getting the first half brushed then covered in dumpster juice which is a combination of rain water and garbage and is very acidic and very harsh on the paint job then cat urine then getting smashed with hammers then being repainted in a color of their choosing when carl protests gas pumps into the room and carl and carl jr arrive and after pointing out that he his son and carl have the exact same name demand his brain be removed a demand which shocks meatwad 
later carl with a giant hole in his head kneels by his completely defiled car mindlessly licking it shake condones this offering him a knife to remove his jaw so he can eat the car frylock eventually discovers what has happened and despite meatwads insistence that he may lose his job if they cause trouble they all go to the car wash the brains have carls brain propped up by the highway and are upset that it is not responding to their orders when carl the floating brain explains his plan of taking peoples brains to work at the car wash frylock dismisses it as retarded before frylock can do anything about it the brains leave saying they are closed but before they go inform them they will open at ten the next day

in a flashback sasuke reminisces the night his entire clan was killed and how he came home to find his parents dead and itachi standing over them confronting his brother sasuke is subject to itachis tsukuyomi who shows him how he killed the clan causing sasuke to collapse from the experience back in present time as kisame and itachi contemplate how best to carry naruto sasuke arrives and attacks itachi with his chidori uninterested in their quarrel itachi effortlessly stops the attack naruto attempts to summon a toad but kisame absorbs his chakra before he can do so and proceeds to attack jiraiya arrives to block the attack  
although jiraiya prepares to fight the two akatsuki members sasuke proclaims that he will kill itachi itachi brutally beats and berates his brother even using tsukuyomi sasuke falls unconscious and jiraiya uses the ensuing chaos to prepare a powerful technique forcing the akatsuki team to flee might guy arrives and takes sasuke back to konoha before he leaves he asks that naruto and jiraiya to find tsunade hoping that she will be able to heal lees injuries they reassure him and naruto and jiraiya set out to resume their search  
naruto enjoys a day out on the town while jiraiya does some investigating into tsunades whereabouts when jiraiya ends up using his time - and narutos money - to enjoy sake and women he starts teaching naruto the rasengan after a conflict with ex-chunnin ninjas to begin learning the technique naruto must pop a water-filled balloon held in the palm of his hand by spinning the water with his chakra something he starts with great enthusiasm  
soon after his training begins naruto finds himself unable to make any progress after asking jiraiya for tips naruto decides he will master the jutsu in three days jiraiya doubts the likelihood that naruto will live up this promise explaining that the rasengan was developed by the fourth hokage in a duration of three years he then goes on to explain that popping the balloon is only one of three steps and leaves naruto to resume his trainingnaruto soon discovers that popping the balloon is easier if he uses both of his hands after observing a cat and progresses to the second step the second stage requires the bursting of a rubber ball naruto tries for weeks and eventually manages to burst the ball but with great struggle and pain  
the second step involves naruto popping a rubber ball something that will require much more power after naruto struggles with this step jiraiya helps him by drawing a leaf on his palm to give him a point to concentrate his efforts on with some additional practice naruto is able to complete this stage as well elsewhere tsunade an avid and extremely unlucky gambler hits a winning streak leading her to believe something bad is about to happen she is correct as when she tries to leave the city she is met by orochimaru and kabuto  
naruto is tasked with combining the spinning and the power developed in the previous steps something that jiraiya cannot help him with as he attempts to do both a frail and sickly orochimaru asks tsunade to heal his soulless decayed arms as the effects of the reaper death seal inflicted on him are causing him excruciating pain although she has no intentions of helping orochimaru due to his killing their teacher tsunade decides to consider the matter when he offers to revive her dead brother nawaki and lover dan  
orochimaru gives tsunade a week to think about it and he leaves while tsunade has dinner that night jiraiya and naruto arrive at the same bar suspicious of jiraiyas reason for looking for her tsunade asks what he wants to which he replies that konoha wants her to be the new hokage she rejects the offer saying anyone who would willingly take the title is a fool naruto enraged that she would disrespect the title of hokage and those who have held its position challenges tsunade to a battle the two step outside but tsunade quickly proves to be far out of narutos league unwilling to give up naruto readies his imperfect rasengan for an attack  
recognizing the danger the attack imposes tsunade forces it into the ground where the minor damage it inflicts indicates that it is not yet complete despite this tsunade offers naruto a proposition if he can master the technique in one week shell give him her necklace something worth an immense amount of money if he cannot she gets all the money in his wallet naruto agrees to the bet and leaves to start training tsunade meets jiraiya for drinks where he tells her that he is aware orochimaru has offered her something jiraiya makes it clear that he will kill her if she helps orochimaru meanwhile naruto continues to train intent on winning the bet with tsunade  
as the week goes by naruto continues his training though he is unable to properly mix spinning and power and has varying results tsunade watches narutos progress from the background noting how similar he is to both nawaki and dan once a week goes by naruto appears to have been unsuccessful and lays unconscious with fatigue jiraiya still uncertain about the situation with orochimaru &amp tsunade decides to take her out for drinks and reminds her about the bet with naruto while theyre out together tsunade drugs his drink putting him to sleep the next morning tsunade meets with orochimaru as promised and prepares to heal his arms before she can do so she is stopped by kabuto  
having recognized that tsunades healing jutsu was filled with killing intent kabuto realized that she had no intention of helping orochimaru with tsunade being the only person who can heal orochimaru kabuto decides to force her to help as they begin to fight although tsunade has far more battle experience than kabuto he is able to hold his own against her even managing to land a few debilitating attacks as kabuto prepares to put tsunade out of commission naruto jiraiya and tsunades assistant shizune arrive to help uninterested in their assistance tsunade tries to resume her battle with kabuto until he learns of her hemophobia and uses it against her as she is taken aside to recover naruto and shizune both launch attacks at kabuto which he defeats finally jiraiya states that he and shizune must team up to take on orochimaru and kabuto respectively  
with tsunade out of commission due to her paralyzing fear of blood jiraiya takes on the challenge of defeating orochimaru kabuto continues to insult tsunade which angers naruto and gives him the strength to fight kabuto and protect tsunade however naruto is no match for kabuto who picks on naruto and brings back tsunades memories of nawaki dan and the bet made between her and naruto naruto in the heat of battle on the spot creates a unique method using a shadow clone to help divide the roles of rotating the chakra and is able to pull together all the strength he has left to make one final attack with his right hand creating a shadow clone and pulling off a complete rasengan having have defeated kabuto naruto passes out after mastering the new jutsu  
despite using a powerful healing technique kabutos wounds are too extensive for him to deal with when naruto collapses due to the severity of kabutos last attack a strike to narutos heart tsunade does what she can determined to save him and his dream of becoming hokage her efforts work and he regains consciousness long enough to claim the necklace he has won in the bet orochimaru recognizing naruto as a potential future threat tries to kill him tsunade determined to make sure naruto becomes hokage overcomes her fear of blood and uses herself as a human shield to block the attack when asked why she would risk her life to save him tsunade replies that it is her duty as the fifth hokage finally accepting the role she was offered intending to eliminate his former teammates orochimaru summons manda while tsunade and jiraiya summon katsuyu and gamabunta respectively  
katsuyu and gamabunta double-team manda though the latter is able to hold his own using her inhuman strength tsunade is able to pin manda down and delivers a finishing blow to orochimaru deciding to use his last resort to regain the use of his arms orochimaru retreats with kabuto leaving tsunade jiraiya shizune and naruto to their own devices once naruto recovers and learns of tsunades acceptance of the hokage title he remarks that she is an undeserving of the job because the third was better in every possible way the two step outside to have another fight though this time tsunade gives naruto a kiss on the forehead instead of a blow to the face the group then sets off for konoha  
on their way back to konoha the group takes a break at a hot spring town naruto learns that two ninja of the akagi family cannot return home unless they collect tsunades debts and attempts to help them shizune fearing that tsunades debts if exposed would jeopardize her chances of becoming hokage disguises herself as tsunade to stop naruto but neither of them realizes that the debt had already been paid  
upon arriving in konoha preparations are made to formally put tsunade into office though she is largely uninterested in formalities and leaves the task to her new assistants she makes her rounds in the konoha hospital healing kakashi and sasuke of the damage done to their minds by itachis tsukuyomi when examining the wounds to rock lees body tsunade discovers that the damage to his spine is too extensive even for her to heal with certainty she advises lee to give up on his dreams of being a ninja citing that there is only a 50% chance that he will survive the operation  
unable to escape tsunade as her grandfathers successor konohamaru does everything in his power to prevent her inauguration as tsunade does research hoping to increase the chances of lees surviving the operation naruto tries to convince konohamaru that she will be a good hokage after tsunade demonstrates her strength and healing abilities konohamaru decides tsunade can be hokage and that his grandfather will not fade into memory  
guy and lee discuss the operation and lee expresses his fears of dying as well as his fears of never being a ninja the two reminisce about their time together and guy finally decides that if lee dies during the operation so will he as he cannot live if lee is not a ninja guys words inspire lee and he decides to take the operation tsunade meanwhile manages to increase the odds of lees survival to 58% and is satisfied that lee will most likely survive the operation tsunade is inaugurated as hokage and the role of the villages protector is passed on to her  
in this episode based on a special omake naruto convinces sakura and sasuke to help him see what kakashis face looks like under his mask each one of their plans such as buying him ramen to force him to remove his mask while he eats fails in a comedic fashion at the same time they inadvertently and unknowingly thwart attempts by three ninja to kill kakashi for goofy reasons finally kakashi agrees to take off his mask revealing another slightly paler mask beneath it  
team 7 without kakashi is given a mission to protect a young man idate during his foot race against a rival clan that will settle the feud between the two idate however has a strong distaste for ninja at the start of the race he runs off in the wrong direction confusing everyone  
team 7 follows idate to another port which makes for a better starting point of the boating part of the race due to the winds and the current en route they are attacked by the rain ninja from the chunin exam who have been hired by the other clan team 7 defends idate and tell him to swim for the shore while they follow later he does so but is confronted by aoi an amegakure ninja  
aoi taunts idate and attacks him team 7 who are still swimming for the island are attacked underwater by the rain ninja using the first step of training for the rasengan naruto creates a huge whirlpool that saves them they then try to rescue idate but prove to be no match for aoi who poisons them and leaves sakura gives them all medicine tsunade had given her and they seek shelter in a cave idate explains that he was once a leaf ninja but was tricked by aoi into betraying the village after failing the chunin exam  
fukusuke continues to celebrate with women and food when aoi warns him that he might be celebrating prematurely naruto uzumaki carrying idate ascends the long flight of stairs to the modoroki shrine idate grabs the orb and heads out on his own two feet but they are soon confronted by aoi waiting with tobiramas sword of raijin that he had idate steal for him both narutos rasengan and sasukes chidori are repelled by the sword though the latter is able to crack it slightly  
when sakura haruno and sasuke uchiha are defeated it is up to naruto to defeat aoi so idate can continue the race after a few failed attacks naruto is finally able to defeat aoi which means idate can continue the race though fukusuke is already near the finish line with determination and encouragement from naruto idate manages to catch up and win the race saving the wasabi clan  
as shikamaru is officially promoted to chunin while lee accepts undergoing the operation sasuke is recuperating in the hospital after the injuries he received in the land of tea angry and jealous that naruto has continued to get stronger while he is still not strong enough to defeat itachi he challenges naruto to a fight when he and sakura come to visit naruto accepts and the two head to the roof after exchanging several attacks naruto creates a rasengan and sasuke prepares his chidori the two rush towards each other with sakura screaming for them to stop  
as naruto and sasuke are about to clash kakashi hatake appears and deflects them into differing water towers sasuke finds narutos tower to be considerably worse off and only comes to envy narutos strength more upon seeing the actual damage kakashi takes sasuke aside and lectures him about not attacking friends sasuke said if anyone get killed who means something to him maybe he listen kakashi then tells him that he is too late to test it out because they are all already dead kakashi tells sasuke that revenge will not truly bring happiness to him and is the wrong answer and leaves him trusting he will not choose vengeance meanwhile sakura asks naruto on a date that he had asked her a long time ago when they were first assinged to team 7 while sasuke debates on whether to stay with the village or take revenge on itachi the sound four arrive and attack him  
sasuke continues his battle with the sound four but eventually becomes too injured including being weakened by using the curse mark the sound four tell stories of how sasuke can become stronger if he lended himself to orochimaru sasuke tired of playing ninja games finally gives in and goes to them sakura tries to stop him but fails as sasuke vanishes before she can persuade him more and he knocks sakura unconscious after saying thank you  
when sakura awakens she informs tsunade of sasukes defection unable to send higher ranking ninja after sasuke tsunade orders shikamaru nara to assemble a team of genin under his lead to go after sasuke he selects naruto neji hyuga choji akimichi and kiba inuzuka and quickly devises the optimal formation for the group before they leave sakura pleads to naruto to make sure to bring sasuke back naruto promises to do so and the group sets out  
as the first step in gaining power sasukes cursed seal must be advanced to its second state for this to happen the sound four seals sasuke into a barrel and carry him from konoha as his seal advances they are confronted by two nearby konoha ninja raido namiashi and genma shiranui but eventually defeat them thanks to their cursed seals after carrying sasuke for a ways the sound four takes a break giving the recently caught up retrieval team a chance to try a sneak attack their presence is detected and the sound four attacks them before they can make a move  
although the sound fours attack seems to force the retrieval team on the defensive shikamaru intended to be caught and uses the opportunity to capture the sound four with his shadow they manage to escape and jirobo captures the retrieval team in a dome of rocks as the other sound four members go on ahead jirobo absorbs the konoha ninjas chakra before their chakra is completely absorbed choji manages to break out of the dome freeing the team  
freed choji volunteers to stay behind and deal with jirobo to give the rest of the team a chance to catch up to the other sound four members as the team goes on choji eats the first of the akimichis three colored pills increasing his strength doing so proves enough to overpower jirobo forcing him to advance his cursed seal to its first level with jirobo now having the upper hand choji takes the second akimichi pill  
with the second pill in his system choji uses the multi-size technique to dramatically increase his size and fall upon jirobo to escape the crushing effects of chojis increased bulk jirobo advances to level 2 of his cursed seal enabling him to lift choji and toss him aside outmatched choji considers taking the last pill while all of the pills he has taken thus far have been harmful to him the third almost guarantees death to the user thinking of shikamaru nara  choji takes the pill allowing him to easily overpower and kill jirobo his battle won choji begins to follow his friends path though falls unconscious before making it very far  
when the retrieval team catches up with the sound four they are quickly caught in kidomarus webs as kidomaru is about to finish off naruto neji frees himself from the webbings and saves the rest of the team because only his gentle fist style can break kidomarus chakra-infused webbing neji decides to deal with him himself instructs the others to go on without him and begins to fight kidomarukidomaru finds out how neji can cut his webbingsalthough kidomaru soon believes himself to have the advantage neji readies his eight trigrams sixty-four palms to prove him wrong  
kidomaru manages to shield himself from the attack and flees to the safety of the neighboring trees deciding to attack neji from a distance kidomaru advances his seal to its first level and sends multiple spiders to attack neji neji is able to repel them all though kidomaru notices a delayed reaction in some of nejis blocks he theorizes that nejis defenses has a blind spot and attacks him further from this blind spot his theory is proven correct as neji is unable to block the attack believing himself to have found nejis weakness kidomaru prepares to finish the battle  
after advancing his cursed seal to its second state and creating a bow and arrow with his webs kidomaru begins taking shots at nejis blind spot neji is able to block the attacks enough to keep them from hitting vital areas though is still left heavily damaged with each of kidomarus attacks ready to finish the battle kidomaru prepares his most deadly arrow for use and fires it at neji neji takes the arrow full force though already knowing of his blind spot moves at the last second to keep the arrow from piercing his heart with kidomarus arrow connected to him by a web neji sends his chakra into the web paralyzing kidomaru as kidomaru lies helpless neji approaches him and deals a finishing blow his injuries too severe neji collapses leaving the retrieval of sasuke up to the others  
orochimaru his body left useless after his failed invasion of konoha anxiously waits for sasuke so that he can switch to sasukes body although he puts it off for as long as he can hoping that the sound four will arrive in time his body brings him too much pain and he is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners elsewhere the retrieval team catches up with the sound four and tries to get sasuke back  
soon after the battle begins kiba and his dog akamaru fall off a cliff with sakon shikamaru engages tayuya while naruto goes after kimimaro who is carrying sasukes coffin desperate to get sasuke back naruto begins tapping into the demon foxs chakra to engage kimimaro as the battle between shikamaru and tayuya begins tayuya summons three creatures to help her in combat with kiba and sakons battle already underway elsewhere sakons brother ukon reveals himself to help sakon fight  
as tayuya guides her three beasts after shikamaru she activates the first level of her cursed seal to make controlling them easier naruto too begins his battle creating a great deal of shadow clones with which to attack kimimaro though kimimaro is able to defeat the clones by the dozens as the fight between kiba and akamaru vs sakon and ukon rages on ukon pushes his cursed seal into its second level recognizing the huge increase in strength that this allows the brothers kiba and akamaru combine to become a giant double-headed wolf the combined beast charges towards sakon and ukon though the brothers are able to block the attack as the wolf transformation disperses akamaru is attacked and left heavily injured and ukon merges himself with kibas body needing to get rid of ukon to save akamaru kiba stabs himself in the stomach causing him and ukon to start coughing up blood  
ukon separates from kiba and rejoins with sakon so that he can recover kiba finds akamaru and the two flee down river hoping to escape the brothers naruto meanwhile is unable to make a dent in kimimaro and his shadow clones are still rapidly defeated before they can land a blow shikamaru elsewhere believes to have picked up on the movements of tayuyas creatures though she quickly has them switch actions before shikamaru can act  
despite tayuyas efforts shikamaru has devised a plan to defeat her creatures using a flash bang to lengthen the shadows in the area shikamaru captures the creatures and prepares to turn them against tayuya to prevent this tayuya calls off the creatures making them disperse despite this tayuya is captured by shikamarus shadow forcing her to advance her seal to its second state to escape with tayuya now strong enough to overpower his shadow shikamaru decides instead to use his shadow for attack and attempts to use his shadow to strangle her  
as naruto starts getting frustrated with his lack of progress sasukes cursed seal finally reaches its second level allowing him to exit his coffin and go on ahead kimimaro prevents naruto from going after him though the arrival of the newly recovered rock lee forces him to let naruto go lee and kimimaro begin exchanging blows though kimimaros unique control over his bones makes things difficult for lee soon after the fight begins lee asks for a timeout so that he can take his medicine kimimaro agrees and lee drinks the contents of his medicine bottle because lee grabbed sake instead of medicine when he set out to help the retrieval team lee is immediately intoxicated and attacks kimimaro in a drunken frenzy  
in his drunken form lees movements are unpredictable and kimimaro is left unable to dodge his attacks as lee begins gaining the advantage in the fight kimimaro is forced to use his more powerful abilities lee however begins to sober up and reverts to his previous state easily being outclassed by kimimaro kimimaro prepares to finish lee off tayuya starts fighting shikamarus shadow and sakon and ukon find kiba and akamaru before any of the sound four members can attack the konoha ninja gaara temari and kankuro arrive at each battle site to take care of the sound four members themselves  
the arrival of the sand ninja surprises the konoha retrieval team and the sound four although the konoha ninja ask their saviors to flee each refuses having been asked to come to help by tsunade kibas nose saves kankuro from a sneak attack ukon underestimates kankuro and his puppet reeceding from their cursed-seal state but the latter is soon able to trap both ukon and sakon in a second of his puppets and kill them with temaris arrival tayuya escapes to the surrounding trees for cover though temaris fan cuts through the forest eliminating tayuya with ease  
lee wanting to assist gaara in his fight attacks kimimaro but his bodys too weak and gaara tells him hes only getting in the way gaara unveils his new techniques but kimimaro continues to reapproach him much to lee and gaaras dismay all the while naruto continues his relentless search for sasuke  
recognizing the potency of gaaras attack and the strength of his defenses kimimaro hardens a bone around his arm into the shape of a drill with this his strongest weapon kimimaro charges at gaara though gaaras final defense proves too much and it shatters calling upon the sand in the ground gaara pulls kimimaro deep underground confining him there until his eventual death as kimimaro sinks he creates a forest of bones to burst from the ground which gaara is able to help lee avoid at the last second as the two sit completely exhausted but relieved to have won kimimaro appears from one of the bones with his bone drill for a final attack his disease gets the best of him at the last second and he dies before he can finish gaara and lee elsewhere naruto has caught up to sasuke  
naruto asks sasuke if he is willing to turn his back on all of his friends in konoha for the simple matter of getting stronger sasuke says yes and starts to walk away enraging naruto determined to bring sasuke back to his senses and to konoha naruto grabs hold of him and starts to punch him he makes sasuke spit out blood with every punch then sasuke rallies and easily repels naruto sasuke tells naruto that he doesnt dream of the future only the past as he recalls his close bond with his older brother itachi naruto tries using force again and attacks sasuke but sasuke doges it and uses dragon flame jutsu and sends it towards naruto

sasuke and narutos fight progresses slowly as sasuke continues to remember his childhood in his memories sasuke learns the fire ball jutsu thus gaining his fathers attention as fugaku uchiha tells him not to follow his brothers foot steps he then starts to wonder if he is only to replace his brother his mother confirms everything else is okay however after doing this he remembers heading to school and deciding that he will not lose to itachi in the present time naruto and sasuke begin to fight  
as sasukes remembrance of his childhood draws to a close sasuke returned home from the academy one day to find all the members of the uchiha clan murdered upon finding his parents bodies sasuke discovered itachi to be responsible for the massacre using his mangekyo sharingan itachi showed sasuke their parents deaths causing sasuke to run with fright itachi stopped him telling him that he wasnt worth killing as itachi left he informed sasuke that if he wanted to take revenge for the clan he would need to get stronger to help sasuke gain the strongest ability of the uchiha itachi tells sasuke the requirements to obtain his own mangekyo sharingan he must kill his closest friend with that itachi left leaving sasuke to build a hate for his brother resolving to get stronger sasuke decided he would do whatever was necessary to kill itachi returning to the present day he tells naruto that he will kill him because naruto is his best friend  


while naruto uzumaki battles sasuke uchiha kakashi hatake learns of sasukes defection from tsunade and is confronted by sakura haruno after trying to calm sakura down kakashi heads off to search for sasuke and naruto meanwhile believing naruto to be his closest friend sasuke prepares to kill him in hopes that narutos death would be an acceptable price for his sharingan to evolve into a mangekyo sharingan narutos rasengan and sasukes chidori clash though neither is capable of overpowering the other activating his cursed seal in order to gain an advantage sasuke mercilessly beats naruto but his chidori nearly hits narutos heart while sasuke thinks the battle to be won the nine-tailss chakra begins to envelop naruto as his wounds are healed as he resolves to beat sasuke to a bloodied pulp if that is what it will take to bring him home  
narutos newfound power overwhelms sasuke as he yells at naruto about not knowing how it feels to lose a family but naruto having known the pain of not having a family explains that he considers sasuke as a brother sasuke puts on his headband while proclaiming that naruto will not be able to hit it as he manages to fully develop his sharingan and is now able to read narutos quick movements and counterattack even when using shadow-clones sasuke manages to inflict numerous devastating and bone-crushing attacks on naruto it is not until sasuke slams him from the sky all the way to the ground that naruto is still and beaten needing more strength to fight naruto calls upon even more of the nine-tailss chakra as it covers his body due to the movement of the chakra cloak sasuke cannot read narutos movements this shroud also acts as a shield and sasukes attacks are quickly dispersed before reaching naruto the tangible chakra also acts as a potent weapon negating the sharingans prediction abilities and allowing naruto to attack from afar by extending the chakra into a claw-like attack as the demon fox-form continues its ravaging onslaught sasuke is put on the defensive forcing him to advance his cursed mark powers to its final level to compensate  
after activating stage 2 of his cursed mark sasuke transforms into a winged equal to naruto in power both remembering their time as teammates sasuke enlightens naruto that they are in the valley of the end and mentions the irony of it as a fitting place to settle things between them once and for all with naruto and sasuke at their peaks of power the two prepare their final attacks narutos nine-tails chakra infused rasengan and sasukes curse-mark enhanced chidori collide and forming a dome around the two boys as they exchanged numerous blows before sasuke slashes narutos chest with the last of his strength naruto succeeds leaving a deep scratch on sasukes headband standing over naruto sasuke attempts how impressed he was in his opponents last act before his headband fall off refusing to follow the same path as his brother and also remembering what naruto means to him sasuke decides to gain power his own way and heads to orochimaru kakashi arrives soon after to see a knocked-out and injured naruto carrying him away while unaware that a mysterious member of the akatsuki had watched the entire fight unfold from underground

on their way to the palace of the sea god robins group meets an entranced zoro it looks like zoro wants to fight so luffy urges the others to keep going without him they apprehend the kid but the whistle was what was really stealing their memories zoro returns still entranced but luffys nowhere to be seen  
luffy returns and knocks some sense into zoro cornered the sea horse spreads illusions of the people in their memories to distract them it steals their complete memories and claims that it has become a sennenryu luffy defeats it and returns all the memories but the townspeople are convinced theyre the memory stealers  
luffy rescues foxy hamburg and porche from a storm at sea when they reunite with the sexy foxy ship they find it captained by somebody new foxy accepts a davy back fight in order to regain his ship and crew donning the afro once again luffy vows to defeat the captain  
once foxy wins back his crew he captures the strawhats nami and luffy fight foxy and although hes defeated his crew accepts him back later they sail to an island where they meet someone robin knows a marine named aokiji  
the man they met marine high admiral aokiji appears to be incredibly lazy he first displays his devils fruit ability by freezing the sea so some deserted people can get off the island unfortunately hes determined to catch robin luffy sanji and zoro attack but they seem to be no match  
robin is frozen by aokiji and luffy tells the others to escape with her in the going merry usopp and chopper try to thaw her in the shower luffy gets defeated frozen but his life is spared as aokiji believes he must repay the debt the marines incurred from crocodiles defeat at luffys hands with the crew defrosted they continue sailing as usual zoro spots the giant frog they heard about and they chase it to an island with a lighthouse but it appears theyll sink before they get there  


after the going merry narrowly escapes being hit by a sea train the crew meets an old woman kokoro and her granddaughter chimney kokoro gives luffy a map to water seven luffy nami and usopp buy boats driven by sea monsters called yagara  
luffy nami and usopp get strange greetings from the residents and they get to experience the roller coaster-like channels of water seven luffy find out that some pirates had been beaten at the hands of some powerful craftsmen the galley la company chopper loses robin and some strange new people threaten zoro back on the ship  
the people who attacked zoro reveal themselves to be the feared franky family though theyre no match for zoro luffy have their gold exchanged for cash after they meet a man who resembles usopp galley las carpenter employment foreman kaku usopps cut of the money is stolen by the franky family  
paulie makes his debut when he retrieves usopps stolen money as he runs from debt collectors kalifa shows luffy nami and usopp around dock no 1 and tells them how iceburg founded the galley la company kaku returns from the going merry and tells them that their keel is irreparably damaged  
luffy refuses to believe that galley la cannot repair the going merry the two soon realize that not only is usopp missing now but the two brief cases that were returned to them are empty nami decides to head to franky house and finds usopp on the way in a pitiful state as she heads back to the ship for help usopp goes to the franky house himself  
luffy sanji zoro and chopper follow usopps bloody trail to the franky house where they find him passed out in front the four of them challenge the franky family only to find out that their real target franky himself is gone and has taken the money with him  
once theyre back on the ship luffy has to finally tell usopp that the going merry can no longer be repaired and that theyve chosen to get a new ship without him usopp believes that luffy has abandoned the dignity of their ship and says hes leaving the crew that night he challenges luffy to a duel  
usopp fights luffy in order to decide who keeps the going merry he fights harder than hes ever fought before luffy actually seems to pose no threat but all the while hes remembering what great friends they used to be sailing together on the same ship even after taking a harsh beating luffy defeats usopp they leave usopp and the ship behind  
the strawhats get themselves a hotel room nami finds the crew on the roof with urgent news iceburg has been shot as the galley la company frantically search for answers nami and luffy decide to check on his condition – only to be met by closed gates franky appears then to exact his revenge – with style  
in the streets outside of the hospital luffy fights franky inside iceburg recalls seeing nico robin and another tall man before he was shot the galley la company run outside and stop franky and luffy and tell them that they suspect the strawhat pirates of the crime  
the galley la company continues to fight luffy and franky is enraged that theyve stolen his opponent an incredibly high tide called the aqua laguna is coming and chopper and sanji rush to warn usopp luffy raises some chaos in order to meet with iceburg and he demands to know whats happening iceburg says he wants to see robin one more time  
in a bar franky talks with kokoro about her theory on who shot iceburg the rumors she speaks of seem to have some truth as we see robin meeting with someone from an organization called cp9 while the crew hide from angry residents sanji and chopper discover robin and she tells them what theyve feared shes responsible and she wants to part ways  
chopper reunites with the others without sanji and they discuss whats happened luffy decides that in order to know the full truth they must catch robin usopp attempts to repair the ship enough to withstand the aqua laguna and the strawhats make their way to the galley la company  
the strawhats still missing sanji rush to galley la where robin and cp9 begin a raid in iceburgs room robin and the mysterious man iceburg saw before tell him that theyve purposely placed the blame on the pirates their true aim is the blueprints he wouldve passed down to paulie luffy separates from his group  
robin speaks with iceburg inside his room still we already know that robin can read the poneglyphs - and it seems iceburg is the one with the blueprints to the ultimate weapon pluton the true enemies are revealed to be iceburgs own allies elsewhere luffy is tied up with paulie after paulie tells members of cp9 that his blueprints are fake  
lucci tells iceburg their hypothesis and has kaku check his pulse to tell if the things he tells him are true they suspect that iceburgs friend from the past cutty flam is really franky and its revealed to be true therefore franky has the real blueprints the strawhat pirates and paulie break into the room where they find iceburg and cp9  
luffy and the others request that robin comes back to the crew she refuses and tells them that she cannot accomplish her wish if she were to stay with them robin turns to leave and cp9 try to hold the pirates back robin successfully escapes and lucci shows those remaining his transformation  
luccis transformation is a result of a devils fruit a zoan type leopard he quickly disposes of the crew and cp9 tie up paulie and iceburg leaving them alone as the building slowly burns down around them in frankys underground hideout usopp tells him his story and franky is finally touched in return franky tells him a little about toms contributions to water seven  
usopp believes that the person who repaired the going merry in skypeia was really the going merry itself franky says that the ship was inhabited by a spirit who enters ships who are dearly cared for the spirit repaired their ship just enough for them to reach the next island the doorbell rings from the sea side and the galley la foremen enter  
the foremen discover frankys hidden room and he fears theyll trample his memories a long flashback ensues covering frankys past in toms workers and how he and iceburg helped create the sea train  
frankys flashback spandam a cp5 representative was determined to get tom proven guilty in his trial so he could get the blueprints as franky walked into the town people from the government began to attack with the battleships he had personally constructed tom and iceburg run to their shipyard where theyre attacked by two ships which also destroy the others iceburg tells franky that he has to take responsibility or hell never forgive him  
frankys flashback franky said that if a ship of his were to be used as a weapon then its no longer one of his ships that enraged tom and he punched franky for the first time telling him he had to take pride in the ships he created he then told the judge that he would accept the punishment for both his previous crime and the recent attack franky tried to stop the train to enies lobby with his bare hands  
chopper escapes the burning building with paulie and iceburg on his back and collapses outside iceburg tells nami that cp9 threatened to destroy the straw hats if robin didnt cooperate with them nami rushes to tell chopper so they can go looking for the rest of the crew elsewhere the foremen let go of the going merry so she would be destroyed at sea  
paulie helps clear the name of the strawhats but doesnt tell the mob everything he knows he gets the mob to follow chopper so they can search for the rest of the crew nami goes her own way so she can rush to the sea train as nami nears the station sanji ahead of her approaches the train  
nami and the conductors are rescued by paulie when the aqua laguna floods the main station a man hands nami a letter he found from sanji it informs her that usopp franky and he are on board the train that had just departed on board he storms the cars high up in the city nami speaks with kokoro and spots luffy stuck in between two buildings in the back streets where the aqua laguna will hit first  
nami finally reaches luffy and tells him that he needs to hurry before robin reaches enies lobby chopper finds zoro and hands him the sandai kitetsu so he can escape the chimney luffy pushes apart the buildings he was stuck between and paulie grabs them all so they can escape the aqua lagunas massive wave  
sanji fights his way through another train car and finds usopp and franky seeing how determined luffy is to save robin kokoro and iceburg lends the strawhat crew the use of another sea train rocket man the franky family shows up pleading with luffy to let them join them because theyll do anything for their leader  
the rocket man finally makes it out to sea as the train connects with the tracks luffy has to rescue chimney before shes thrown off by the wind in the meanwhile iceburg has a flashback about when he finally met franky again in water seven with luffy and chimney safe in the train paulie tells his fellow carpenters who the real culprits were the strawhats franky family and galley la company form an alliance  
luffy and zoro perform a move that acts similar to a cannon and blasts a hole through the wall of the tidal wave ahead of them opening up a channel for them to pass through they miraculously pass through unscathed and the passengers rejoice sanji contacts the rest of the crew and fills them in on his current situation usopp separates from them but later when sanji and franky are spotted a man named sogeking comes to their rescue  
sogeking makes his grand entrance franky and sanji arent fooled by his costume but they try to humor him they devise a plan first then detach the last two cars and fight their way through the rest back in the rocket man luffy zoro nami and chopper get an outfit change nami shows off the weapon usopp upgraded for her while he was still with them  
kalifa updates the cp9 on the situation with franky sanji and usopp sanji tells franky and usopp to go on without him so he can fight wanze and his ramen kenpo franky begins to fight nero cp9s weasel and sogeking meets with robin  
frankys fight with nero continues nero discovers that frankys weak spot is his back so franky lies down flat so he cant get to it nero demands that he fight seriously so franky gets up to perform his centaur form sogeking talks with robin and tells her that the crew knows about her reasons for leaving those on the rocket man encounter the discarded cars and zoro slices them so they can pass  
zoro clashes with ship cutter t-bone the fight is short and zoro joins the crew again in the rocket man on the puffing tom sanji beats wanze beautiful though wanze thinks hes ruined his face franky finally gains the upper hand against nero and defeats him after beating their respective opponents franky and sanji stand to fight against the other cp9  
after hiding under robins cloak for a few episodes sogeking finally shows himself they stumble into the room with the cp9 and meet with sanji and franky sogeking produces a smokescreen the four head into another car detach it and escape its not long before blueno pulls their car back though franky knocks down the wall so they can escape but ends up on the enemy car blueno opens a door then back in the strawhat car  
robin willingly follows blueno into his improvised door and sogeking and sanji are left alone for a while blueno explains a little of robins past involving the buster call back at the rocket man yokuzuna the frog jumps onto the front of the train knocking them from the rails after kokoro speaks with him he joins the group the cp9 franky and robin finally reach enies lobby and disembark

veronica nick and lj are pursued by an agent of the company who takes over from hale and kellerman but the two agents dont like it abruzzi and michael try to figure out how to regain control of pi but to do so michael may have to give up fibonacci he manages to send falzone to a false lead in canada where they face international gun charges and parole violation abruzzi regains control of pi however c-note forces his way onto the escape team 
the escape team and prison staff are shocked to discover that michael has a wife when she arrives to give him an item for the plan a key card to get to his personal effects unfortunately geary steals a watch he needs and enlists tweeners help to recover it westmoreland changes his mind about escaping after hearing that his daughter is dying quinn tracks down veronica nick and lj but they escape and leave quinn the companys agent to die in a well in the end michael realizes that there are too many people in the escape team and they have to remove one 
with one too many people the escape team decides to get rid of t-bag however he tells them that he called someone on the outside and if they dont hear from him they will call the authorities concerning the escape abruzzi decides to have t-bags contacts scared off but ends badly when they end up dead abruzzi plans on killing t-bag but during his crisis of faith he lets him live if he backs out of the escape which results in t-bag slitting his throat and leaving him to die veronica receives a phone call from hale where he says that he has answers and wants to meet up with her lincoln has to stall the guards from uncovering the escape plan which results in him being taken away 
veronica meets up with hale where he tells her that terrence steadman is still alive but before he can give her proof kellerman arrives on the scene and kills him when he finds the papers naming him as an accessory in fox river abruzzi is sent to the hospital the team readies for the escape but michael is unwilling to leave lincoln behind who has been placed in solitary fortunately as usual michael has a plan and secretly sends him a pill which gives him the same effects of food poisoning and is sent to the infirmary one of the key locations of the escape unfortunately on the night of the escape the prison has replaced a corroded pipe meaning the team will not break out 
the first escape attempt fails and with lincolns execution only hours away michael tampers with the electric chair sticking a rat in the circuitry of the electric chair though bellick is one step ahead after appointing tweener as his rat michael pleads for sara to appeal to her father the governor of illinois to review lincolns case but this fails as he works for vice president reynolds on the night he is to be executed michael and veronica say goodbye to lincoln and he is sent to the chair 
lincolns execution is delayed when anonymous evidence comes to their attention for that nick and veronica exhume steadmans body only to find that the body was in fact steadmans with an additional few weeks michael can now continue with the escape plan with plan b he is given a guards uniform from the prisons laundry and sneaks into the prisons asylum undetected to find the pipes which will lead them to the infirmary however on the way back his back is burnt and sara finds evidence of a guards uniform on his wound furthermore his wound has burnt off parts of his tattoo which are vital to the escape plan 
this episode is set three years before michaels incarceration and features the lives of the various main characters prior to their time at fox river the main plot of the episode revolves around the murder set-up that led to lincolns conviction and the reason of michaels decision to save his brother elsewhere it is revealed that sara was a drug addict sucre was set up by one of his cousins after he sees maricruz c-note is dishonorably discharged from the army after reporting prisoner misconduct in kuwait and t-bag is seeing susan hollander who later finds out who he is and turns him to the authorities 
while searching for information regarding the company nick and veronica take quinns cell phone where lj finds clues concerning kellerman he breaks into his house to get revenge for his mothers death but is arrested before he could kill him michael is sent to solitary after he is unable to answer popes questions about his burn sucre is forced to sneak into the co break room to ensure the hole stays undetected he is caught sneaking back though the guards dont learn of the escape plan after he is no use to bellick he has tweener transferred to a cell with a nasty inmate avocado in the end michael fakes a mental breakdown in order to get into the psych ward so he could get assistance with haywire though haywire has no idea who michael is 
michael tries to get haywire to remember him by making him spit out his medication soon haywire remembers and draws the missing piece of his puzzle meanwhile now that michaels cell is empty the escape team works on winning money to buy it before it is auctioned off they win in an illegal poker game thanks to t-bags hands and c-notes bluff geary takes their money but tells the team that he has already auctioned the cell so they frame him for burning scofield and he is quickly fired after lj is arrested a motion has passed allowing lincoln to visit him however on the way the transport van is run off the road by a truck and crashes 
lincoln is rescued from a car crash by his father and learns the reason behind his set-up for steadmans murder unfortunately the authorities and kellerman are tracking him kellerman makes it to the scene first and after confronting lincoln he sees bellick arrive where he gives himself up and kellerman flees veronica finds evidence in quinns cellular phone leading to a residence in blackfoot montana in fox river michael needs the infirmary key to complete the escape plan but is unable to steal it from sara so he asks nika for help however by the time michael is able to make a duplicate of the key sara switches the locks tweener is made aware of the escape plan and tells bellick who finds the hole in the break room 
bellick discovers the hole only to be knocked out by westmoreland though he is injured in the process with this revelation the team must escape tonight with no time or alternatives michael is forced to involve sara in the breakout and asks her to leave the door open for him tweener joins the team veronica plans on going to blackfoot but is stopped by nick who holds her at gunpoint michael also needs popes help so he sabotages the taj mahal model and holds a shank to pope to get him to cooperate 
michael forces pope to have lincoln transferred from solitary to the infirmary before knocking him out nick decides to let veronica go and send her to blackfoot however as nick returns to his father abruzzis man shows up and kills them both michael and his escape crew start breaking out from behind michaels cell during tier-time there they make it through into the psych ward disguised as patients and make it through to the infirmary however haywire joins in on the escape and westmoreland collapses and dies from his injuries but not before telling michael where he left his 5 million michael lincoln abruzzi haywire c-note t-bag tweener and sucre successfully escape from fox river 
now outside the prison walls michael lincoln and six other escapees race for their freedom as the authorities close in on them caroline reynolds is abandoned by the company and decides to take matters into her own hands by having the president assassinated so she can take over veronica arrives in montana and finds the evidence that will prove lincolns innocence the very alive terrence steadman in the getaway van abruzzi had set up for them t-bag handcuffs himself to michael to allow abruzzi to let him live later after they fail to cut the handcuffs abruzzi cuts off his hand the team abandons him tweener and haywire to fend for themselves however the plane abruzzi has arranged leaves without them as the authorities surround the airport and the team is forced to run for it with the authorities right behind them

a pixellated purple ship lands in the street in front of carl and the aqua teens houses two short square-shaped pixellated aliens exit the ship and knock on carls door they identify themselves as ignignokt and err mooninites from the inner core of the moon and members of a race hundreds of years advanced from the people of the earth carl slams the door in their face and the mooninites decide to go next door to the aqua teens house where a sign on the lawn says there is a room for rent 
in their house master shake explains to meatwad that he is renting out meatwads room in order to make money shake answers the door and the mooninites enter as references they spin in place and glow shake gives them the room shakes asks for a deposit and ignignokt offers meatwads jambox shake accepts 
meatwad complains to the mooninites about shake and they show him how to shoot the bird and smoke cigarettes later after swimming in carls pool they attempt to dry a wet towel over frylocks computer frylock is unhappy to learn that shake has rented them meatwads room frylock suspiciously questions the mooninites and he is not impressed when meatwad rolls out of his room smoking a cigarette and asking for alcohol frylock is even more incensed shake breaks out an electric guitar and says that the mooninites gave it to him 
meatwad goes with the mooninites to the mall where ignignokt and err spit in meatwads face until he steals a rack of dvds while the mooninites steal televisions and stereo equipment frylock must retrieve meatwad from mall security while the mooninites make it back safely and mention that they have gouged expletives into carls car carl is angry 
on the way back to their house meatwad shows frylock his tough new clown tattoo in carls pool shake and the mooninites see who can hold their breath underwater the longest carl comes outside and complains about the vandalism to his car and ignignokt takes out mr laser a pixellated pistol-like gun he fires a shot at carl but it moves extremely slowly carl easily moves out of the way and dodges it but it bounces off his house and hits him in the back causing him to disappear 
frylock hovers to the pool surprising master shake they all go back into the aqua teens house and while everyone watches a movie on the television about vegetable man frylock tells the mooninites he wants them to move out when everyone ignores him frylock destroys the television with energy balls from his eyes the mooninites are initially impressed by how fast the balls move but then pretend that the balls were actually primitive 
frylock and the mooninites takes their dispute outside where frylock uses his fries to plaster their flat two-dimensional bodies against the road meatwad rolls outside and shoves frylock off of them saying that the mooninites are his friends when err extinguishes a cigarette in meatwads eye meatwad realizes they may not be his friends after all 
ignignokt then utters the words mooninites unite and the smaller err joins into an err-shaped slot in the top of ignignokt forming the quad laser wherein each of their arms holds a pixellated pistol-like gun after stating that no one can defeat it the mooninites fire shooting an even larger even slower bullet than before in response frylock shoots them with his energy balls and the mooninites quickly flee this primitive rock in their ship 
back on their ship the mooninites raise their middle fingers at the shrinking earth at carls pool shake says he will keep all of the mooninites stolen merchandise because he deserves it having landed in a crater on the moon the mooninites find carl and threaten a moon spanking note first episode to be rated tv-14 
 
in the opening carl is admiring his pool completely decked out with painted flames and neon lights and preventing master shake from getting anywhere near it because he is weird suddenly a black hole appears in the sky and begins to suck up carl frylock tries to help by tying a garden hose around his waist and having shake hold on to it but shake ties it to a loosely-fitted gutter and frylock and carl are sucked into the vortex 
inside the house shake tricks meatwad into climbing inside the dryer when frylock escapes the vortex along with carl whose hands have grown greatly he finds shake inside and berates him for not holding the hose when the dryer stops and meatwad exits he discovers he now has magical static powers which he promptly uses to send shake into midair finally letting him go near the ceiling fan while mainly using his shots of electricity to torment shake he does cause a great deal of harm he shorts out frylocks computer jumps into carls pool while carl had his hand in it blasting him across the yard and electrocuting him and accidentally kills his friend squirrely 
frylock in a desperate attempt to remove meatwads powers has meatwad perform a balloonism having him take a blown-up balloon shaped like squirrely and rub it over his body unfortunately this doesnt work the balloon becomes a massive electrified balloon which becomes even larger when frylock tries to destroy it with electricity from his eyes eventually it floats towards the sea and the aqua teens head towards the beach frylock covers meatwad in shattered glass and throws him in the ocean to pop the balloon unfortunately to get him to float frylock has to remove meatwads brain causing him to only float around in the water and say do what now over and over eventually another vortex opens sucking up both the balloon and meatwad 
back home while shake and frylock are in carls pool with shake claiming he could open the sky at his whim meatwad reappears this time ten times his normal size meatwad asks frylock to get away from the pool and he then proceeds to jump onto shake and the pool as the episode ends 
 
frylock is repeatedly transmitting the first few notes of la cucaracha through a satellite dish on the roof of the aqua teen hunger forces house when he receives a response in the form of a house-shaking low bass note using his computer frylock contacts the aliens and opens a video feed two aliens one green and one orange both basically just a mass of spikes with heads are barbecuing watermelon which has ignited some type of bird and meat on a grill they assure frylock that the fact that they are barbecuing means they are peaceful 
the plutonians oglethorpe and emory argue over whether they have laser eyes then invite frylock up to their ship although oglethorpe is unsure whether they possess a transporter device emory knows they do and initiates the transport as frylock is transporting oglethorpe knocks over the barbecue demanding that the gross shanks of meat leave his dominion and prompting emory to warn him about burning down the ship oglethorpe reveals that he has a plan to betray frylock - he will melt him in the meltorium emory objects thinking they were just going to hang out but oglethorpe insists 
frylock appears with a six-pack of beer oglethorpe initially does not recognize frylock but then invites him into the meltorium frylock declines after a bit of conversation about the plutonians sweatbands/headbands oglethorpe again invites frylock to the meltorium but he again declines frylock asks about their spikes which oglethorpe says are pointy arms emory explains that the spikes eject soap and when frylock says it smells like waste emory further explains that what is soap to one person is waste to another oglethorpe again attempts to lure frylock into the meltorium by tossing a frisbee at it but he only drops it and stomps on it 
frylock asks if there is a higher brain form with which he could speak but there isnt when oglethorpe states that the plutonians plan is to dominate the world frylock expresses his doubt that they could succeed and starts hitting random buttons in an effort to beam himself back home instead he beams master shake aboard frylock finds the correct button and beams himself back to earth the plutonians stare at shake open-mouthed seemingly shocked by his appearance oglethorpe finally expresses his desire to blow up the earth though he seems unsure if that is actually his plan shake does not care and lies down to rest his back which he says hurts after the transporting oglethorpe and emory drag shake into the meltorium 
back at home meatwad shows frylock how he set a small piece of the carpet ablaze frylock chides him about using fire but meatwad has already melted the siding off of carls house in an effort to cut his grass carl who originally paid shake to cut his lawn tells frylock and meatwad that he wants to talk to him as soon as possible

the episode opens with usopp pretending he is in a great battle as captain of the going merry fending off attacking pirates as he is doing so luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship and holds it up its a terribly drawn skull and crossbones of course the others are horrified of the artwork and so usopp tells them that he is a great painter he paints a pirate flag with his own face on it but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag a very nice one at that they fly it on the mast and continue to sail as they are sailing nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope saying it is legendary treasure island usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island but if one tries to claim it they will face gods wrath 
as the straw hats draw nearer to the island the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy after a tough sail they make it to the island the straw hats head into the jungle looking for treasure zoro lies down and starts to nap and as usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this the straw hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals creatures that are combinations of two or more animals a voice booms through the jungle claiming to be the guardian god of the island and telling them to leave luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face the voice is shocked and luffy explains he ate the devils fruit a gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots luffy in the back but luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his gomu gomu powers luffy then spots a twitching green bush and the owner of the voice takes off running 
luffy usopp and nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest named gaimon luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the grand line and claim one piece but gaimon doesnt think he can do it luffy and gaimon converse about how they cant read a map and nami is angered by this gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as zoro finally joins them he explains that twenty years ago he was with his crew in search of the treasure and as they were leaving he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell getting stuck in a treasure box he found that his crew had left and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself but found he could not climb in the box when luffy tries to pull gaimon out of the box he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box and his body will be ruined if the box is broken luffy then realizes that gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors 
inspired by gaimons story the straw hats decide to help gaimon find the treasure they come to the ridge and luffy uses gomu gomu no rocket to launch himself up to the top where there are five treasure chests he refuses to hand them over to gaimon and while this shocks and angers nami and usopp gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty luffy confirms this and so gaimon begins to cry saying that hes been guarding nothing for twenty years luffy says it could be worse as he could have died guarding nothing and he offers gaimon to join their crew gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island however as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure with this adventure behind them the straw hats set sail in the going merry once again waving goodbye to gaimon as the episode draws to a close

in the meantime on the going merry zoro recognizes the intruder who got beat up by luffy from the last episode as johnny johnny then brings the straw hat pirates attention to yosaku who lies ill on his and johnnys small ship turns out that johnny yosaku and zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took yosaku to a small rock island to rest which was coincidentally blown up by usopp and luffy for target practice in the last episode usopp and luffy quickly apologize johnny however was more worried about yosakus condition which nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin c luffy and usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into yosakus mouth and yosaku is revived or at least for 5 minutes the straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as baratie he also states that the one zoro has been looking for hawk-eyes mihawk is near there too 
thus they head to baratie which actually is pretty much right next to where they were they then get passed by fullbodys marine ship fullbody doesnt recognize the straw hat pirates mark but he recognizes johnny and yosaku as worthless pirate hunters johnny responds by shouting this is what pirate hunters do while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air nami takes note of the arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chiefs room in baratie where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year

at the request of his father ryoma echizen moves to japan after having success at tennis in the united states having won four consecutive american junior openings on his way to a japanese tennis tournament he saves sakuno ryuzaki from some thugs due to this he misses the tournament however he finds an opponent in the form of one of the thugs he met on the subway he then puts his opponent sasabe in his place during the match where he reveals his exceptional tennis capabilities  
upon his arrival in seishun academy seigaku for short ryoma teaches a lesson to two juniors who are picking on the freshmen takeshi momoshiro one of the teams regulars puts a stop to it and decides to play ryoma in a tennis match noticing that momoshiro has a bad ankle ryoma decides not to play with his dominant hand also sakunos energetic friend tomoka is introduced to ryoma and instantly proclaims herself to be his number one fan  
the seigaku regulars are introduced while a journalist mamoru inoue and a photographer saori shiba visit seigaku in order to report on the teams upcoming ranking matches meanwhile ryoma defeats a second year non-regular arai using an old broken tennis racket when the latter hides all three of ryomas rackets seeing his skill the captain of the tennis team kunimitsu tezuka enters ryomas name on the roster for the intraschool ranking matches despite the fact that he is a freshman  
the seigaku ranking matches has begun and ryoma and the seigaku regulars continue to win their matches early on in the tournament ryoma then gets pitted against regular kaoru kaido in the third round where the latter reveals his special move the snake shot this throws ryoma off guard so he decides to switch to his dominant hand  
kaido attempts to use his snake shot to wear off ryomas stamina and though ryoma initially shows signs of sweating and fatigue he surprises both kaido and the spectators when his speed and power does not decrease near the end it is revealed that ryoma had been implementing a plan he had been specifically hitting shots that kaido had to bend his knees in order to return thus kaido would lose stamina far faster than ryoma his plan works earning him the win  
inoue plays a match with nanjiro echizen the former samurai nanjiro a legendary tennis professional to get answers about why he retired though nanjiro appears to not be taking it seriously his skills show otherwise and he easily beats inoue with both his eyes closed however inoue finds out that nanjiro is now focusing on developing the skills of his son ryoma meanwhile sakuno looks for ryoma to learn more about him and tennis  
in ryomas next ranking match he plays against inui sadaharu who uses data tennis to counter ryomas play style using the data he gathered from ryomas previous match inui is able to dominate the match by accurately predicting and countering ryomas moves though irritated ryoma refuses to give up and reveals that he is glad to have transferred into seigaku because he can now play against different types of players like inui  
in order to counter inuis data ryoma uses a new technique he had practiced when playing against his father the one-footed split step this requires him to continuously hop in place so he can react faster to the ball as well as be able to move to another part of the court more quickly using this technique ryoma gains enough agility and speed to return inuis calculated shots this along with the twist serve surpasses inuis data and turns the game into ryomas favor  
inui continues to be unable to return ryomas twist serve resulting in his eventual loss ryoma then wins his next games and finally becomes a regular meanwhile inui plays against his next opponent kaido who also surpasses inuis data and takes a spot in the regulars as well with eight spots taken inui loses his place as a regular however seigakus coach sumire ryuzaki asks him to help in the regulars training instead during training he introduces his special and dreaded vegetable juice which most of the regulars fall victim to  
ryoma and the rest of the freshmen go to where kachiros father works as a tennis coach however they find trouble with sasabe again but this time sasabes father is the bigger problem in order to teach him a lesson ryoma asks the father to teach him tennis though sasabe warns his father not to the latter is more than willing to do so in their practice match the father ends up pulling a muscle after ryoma shows him just how much he should have listened to kachiros fathers advice about warming up first  
realizing that the only remaining singles slot left is singles 3 ryoma and momoshiro compete for it when they both want to play singles in the upcoming match against gyokurin middle school however when they decide to settle it with a match they end up playing doubles against locals instead though they defeat their first few challengers they are utterly defeated by two cocky gyokurin players due to their lack of teamwork it is then that the two decide to play doubles in the upcoming match  
momoshiro and ryoma volunteer to play in doubles 2 and develop a tactic to improve their playing coordination however despite their practice they continue to clash with each other due to their natural dominant tendencies as singles players in addition their rivals use a strategy which takes advantage of momoshiro and ryomas lack of coordination turning the game into their favor  
with their new strategy gyokurin continues to dominate irritated ryoma and momoshiro realize that they are truly not suited to be doubles players and agree to split the court in half now they each only have to defend one half of the court and is able to utilize their individual skills though strange it is an effective strategy that wins them the game however due to their shameful performance they still receive punishment from their coach  
fudomine middle school an unknown team that withdrew from last tournament for internal affairs is seigakus next rival in the first game seigakus shusuke fuji and takashi kawamura find themselves struggling against the first fudomine pair forcing fuji to use one of his triple counters tsubame gaeshi a technique that causes the ball to roll rather than bounce once it reaches the opponents side of the court  
determined to overcome fujis skills fudomines tetsu ishida tries a desperate measure to seal fujis tsubame gaeshi by using a hit of considerable strength called hadokyu when he aims it directly toward fuji kawamura decides to get in its way when he realizes that fuji would not be able to return it hoverer though he succeeds in returning it he hurts his wrist in the process forcing seigaku to forfeit the match  
thanks to eiji kikumarus acrobatics and shuichiro oishis ability to adapt to his partners style seigakus golden pair wins their doubles match easily next is the game between kaido and kamio akira where kaorus snake shot turns out to be ineffective against the speed ace from fudomine in a moment of desperation kaido inadvertently performs a near impossible shot around the nets pole which is then dubbed the boomerang snake  
kaido desperately tries to recreate the boomerang snake but he eventually stops his attempts when he decides to just play his style of tennis with neither side yielding kamios and kaidos game becomes an endurance match however in the end kaidos willpower and persistence outlasts kamios stamina also momoshiro learns the identity of the girl he has been recently running into who turns out to be fudomines player-coach and kippei tachibanas younger sister an tachibana  
tezuka found out nanjiro is ryomas father nanjiro echizen finds a letter from ryuzaki and remembers the days when he trained under her as a seigaku regular meanwhile ryomas opponent shinji ibu shows his skills when he is able to return ryomas twist serve as well as his revealing his own serve the kick serve which is similar to the twist serve ryoma then switches to his left hand and the game heats up between the two players serves  
ryoma struggles to resist ibus spot a technique where ibu forces ryoma to hit certain shots that temporarily paralyzes his arm however when ryoma tries to spin his body instead of moving his arm the racket gets loose from his grip and it bounces back hitting his eye with his eyelid bleeding it seems impossible for him to continue but he insists on continuing the match  
impressed with his determination tezuka gives ryoma ten minutes to finish the game after which he will forfeit the match in the end ryoma manages to overcome ibus spot and wins the match right before his alloted time had ended with ryomas win seigaku wins the tournament and after tending to his wounds the seigaku regulars celebrate in kawamuras sushi restaurant  
due to their recent victories spies from other schools begin to observe seigakus training when they catch two of the spies spying on them even after school hours momoshiro and ryoma teach the two of them a lesson in a doubles match when the two spies are only able to score one point against them they decide to practice their tennis instead of spying on others  
while kaido starts his daily training momoshiro and kamio akira end up playing a doubles match against two hyotei regulars atobe keigo and munehiro kabaji when the latter two pick on an tachibana meanwhile ryoma and shinji ibu battle over grip tape by creating a contest in which they catch a pickpocket kaido is then unwittingly dragged into the mess when he is suspected of being the thief  
during their new training regimen kaido and oishi are forced to drink inuis special vegetable juice for losing in their training match becoming very sick then when tezuka accidentally drinks all of inuis juice inui is forced to use his golden power remix inui juice on the loser of the kikumaru and ryoma match when ryoma fails to win the game within five shots which was the requirement for him to win he ends being the one to drink it  
ryoma is asked by coach ryuzaki to go to the racket-stringer with sakuno whom he constantly ignores though unknowingly curious what ryoma is up to nanjiro decides to follow him and after seeing the two together momoshiro and the freshman trio spy on the two believing that that they are on a date however ryoma continues to ignore her and even end up hurting her feelings when she asks about him in the end ryoma tries to make up for it by teaching her some tennis  
feeling that ryomas tennis is a simple copy of his fathers tezuka asks coach ryuzaki for permission to play an unofficial match against ryoma before his match tezuka and oishi go to a clinic to check whether or not tezukas arm has healed though it is healed the doctor warns him not to play long matches and to not use his drop shot after finding out he is fine he meets up with ryoma suspicious of the twos meeting oishi decides to follow the pair to see what is really going on  
during their match in order to convince the latter to aim higher with his own style of tennis tezuka risks re-injuring his arm by going all out in the match resulting in ryomas defeat oishi who was the sole spectator of the tezuka and ryoma match talks to tezuka about the outcome and its repercussions the next day at school the other team members grow suspicious when tezuka and ryoma fail to appear during team practice two days in a row meanwhile ryoma asks nanjiro for a match in which the latter realizes that ryoma has changed and will now get stronger  
ryoma accidentally packs his cats karupin favorite toy in his tennis bag so karupin follows him to school and explores the grounds when ryoma finds out his cat is on campus he rushes to find him worried about what may become of him after finding out that ryoma has been relentlessly searching for his cat the other members help him in his search eventually helping him find karupin  
when ryoma oversleeps before the match satoshi horio another freshman is forced to impersonate ryoma but he gets challenged by another player when the latter hears him bragging about his supposed skills luckily for horio ryoma arrives just in time to bail him out meanwhile hajime mizuki the manager of st rudolphs tennis team tells akiyama seigakus opponent how to target the seigaku players weak spots  
the next tournament starts and the seigaku team is informed of their positions momoshiro and kaido are unexpectedly paired up to play doubles 2 against st rudolphs atsushi kisarazu and shinya yanagisawa even though the two have been rivals since they were freshmen ironically however though they argue with each other they appear to be a compatible team who can play on each others strengths and weaknesses  
though momoshiro and kaido are a compatible team they constantly butt heads in the court resulting in them struggling as the opponents also know their strengths and weaknesses as well however the last-ditch appearance of kaidos latest technique the boomerang snake throws mizukis carefully laid plans in disarray since he believed that kaido was unable to perform the technique at will this also motivates momoshiro to evolve as well  
momoshiro knocks out the st rudolph player yanagisawa when his dunk smash accidentally hits the player thus seigaku wins doubles 2 by default eiji and oishi the famed golden pair takes to the courts against st rudolphs ichirou kaneda and its captain yoshirou akazawa in the match mizukis information helps the st rudolph pair tire out eiji which is when oishi reveals his famed technique the moon volley which can land directly on the baseline  
oishi and eiji use a new formation that makes use of their exceptional teamwork but when eiji runs out of energy he resorts to regaining his stamina by standing still on the court in order to give eiji time to regain his strength oishi plays against both the st rudolph players by himself just when the other pair was about to win eiji recovers at match point and saves the ball just in time thanking his teammate for covering for him  
eiji recovers and the golden pair take it to a tiebreaker however just when they have a run of three straight points eiji starts to lose his stamina again st rudolph fights back and wins the match but akazawa accepts that they were lucky while mizuki starts to lose confidence in his data and predictions in the next match in which ryoma is pitted against yuta fuji the latter demonstrates his twist spin shot against ryoma  
ryoma faces yuta fuji shusukes younger brother and also the one rumored to be the lefty-killer the player who specializes in defeating left-handed opponents he quickly runs into trouble due to the opponents tricky rising shot which is able to confuse ryoma due to the balls unusual motion but eventually finds a way to counter it as the match goes yutas reasons for transferring to st rudolph from seigaku is revealed to prove his worth yuta performs his twist spin shot  
with his rising shot and twist spin shot yuta is able to dominate the match but ryoma continues to find a way to counter the combination after he advises yuta to not use his twist spin shot anymore ryoma unveils his new move drive b a technique that bounces in a b shape to counter yutas technique with it ryoma is able to win the match the ruthlessness of mizuki is revealed as he is shown to be the one who taught yuta the twist spin shot despite knowing that it can cause major damage to the users arm  
angered by mizukis treatment of his younger brother fuji decides to teach him a lesson about tennis on the courts though mizuki is confident in the data he has collected on fuji which seemingly goes according to his plan at first the match ends with his complete defeat fuji had lost the first five games on purpose meanwhile fudomine unexpectedly defeats hyotei academy three games to zero  
nanjiro tricks ryoma into teaching sakuno and tomoka tennis while trying to teach the two girls tennis however sakuno accidentally disrupts the practice of a school team in order to help ryoma defeats the entire team not knowing that they are one of seigakus next opponents ginka unbeknownst to them yamabukis jin akutsu who was planning to beat ginka himself is observing the entire event  
akutsu wreaks havoc in seigaku attacking kachiro and arai ryoma intervenes and when akutsu throws a rock at him he is able to hit it back with his racket however when akutsu throws several rocks at him he gets injured in the process when the regulars later spot kawamura and akutsu having a secret meeting they are surprised to find that the two have known each other since childhood  
during training the regulars end up running laps when inui announces that the last person to cross the finish line has to drink his new drink determined not lose they all end up finishing at the same time later ryoma and fuji face off in a practice match where the two decide to go all out during the match fuji reveals his second triple counter the higuma otoshi bear drop which is able to counter ryomas smashes but the latter is determined to find a way to defeat it  
through his continuous attempts ryoma finally figures out a way to defeat fujis counter meanwhile the other regulars continue their own matches with tezuka quickly defeating his opponent momoshiro shortly after the seigaku practice matches are cut short due to rain unsatisfied with the incomplete match fuji and ryoma continue their duel with each other however ryuzaki puts a stop to it scolding and lecturing them about the consequences  
while making their way to their match against yamabuki some fudomine players get into a car accident though they make it to their match the trauma of the accident makes them unable to play at full strength against their opponents after hearing about the accident from akutsu fudomines captain kippei tachibana has his team forfeit the match meanwhile scared of being completely defeated seigakus opponent ginka willingly forfeits their match so seigaku faces their next opponent yamabuki  
before their match against yamabuki taichi dan meets and talks to ryoma about he dan can not be a good tennis player because he is short not knowing that ryoma is a regular during the doubles match oishi is targeted by the jimmies a doubles pair who was victorious over oishi and a senior the previous year however in the end the jimmies overconfidence about their previous win results in eiji and oishis victory  
in the singles match momoshiro plays against kiyosumi sengoku who is nicknamed lucky sengoku due to his outstanding luck during the match though momoshiro seemingly dominates he loses focus when sengoku successfully uses momoshiros signature technique the dunk smash sengoku then reveals his special technique a powerful jumping serve called the tiger cannon that combined with his superb motion vision allows him to take the lead against momoshiro  
desperate to win momoshiro inadvertently performs a high level technique called the jack knife during the match with it momoshiro is able to take the lead and eventually wins the match with sheer will when he realizes he has a cramped foot before his match with akutsu ryoma is warned by his friends about his dangerous opponent however ryoma ends up as the aggressive one when he starts the match out with smashing the ball directly toward akutsus face  
when ryoma hits akutsu in the face with a ball akutsu decides to get serious ryoma is then easily overwhelmed by akutsus physical power unique and unpredictable tennis style and one in ten years talent during their match akutsu reminiscences about his time as a member of a tennis club where he easily and mercilessly defeated its members and captain watching the match taichi dan also ends up recalling the first time he had met akutsu whom he has admired since that day back in the present akutsu tells ryoma that he will not score another point  
akutsus unique playing style continues to overwhelm ryoma meanwhile kawamura reminiscences about akutsus violent history where akutsu is shown to have always been talented in physical activities though ryoma believes he has finally found a way to overcome his opponents unique style and score akutsu shows his potential as a tennis player despite it ryomas determination allows him to finally score a point against akutsu as the match continues ryoma is finally able to adjust to akutsus style  
evolving with each and every play ryoma holds his own against akutsu and finally turns the game around after a flashback of how coach banji recruited akutsu into yamabukis tennis club banji gives akutsu some secret advice in order to help him get back the advantage after seeing that he is starting to struggle with it akutsus determination to win in the tennis match increases forcing back ryoma once again though the latter refuses to back down  
with ryoma one point away from winning the match the two who are now on even footing continue to struggle against each other however in the end ryomas spirit and overwhelming potential help him win in the match and would also win akutsus grudging respect to everyones surprise akutsu then announces his retirement from tennis after the tournaments ceremony taichi dan is inspired to become a tennis player by akutsu and ryoma

during the intraschool ranking matches momoshiro inui and tezuka all end up in the same block meaning that one of them will not become a regular with the other blocks finishing up some of the regulars secure their spot on the team however when momoshiro is defeated by both tezuka and inui he ends up being the one knocked off the team later inui who has been collecting data on his teammates all this time attempts a victory over the intractable tezuka  
though the game starts off evenly matched inui begins to pull ahead by using his determination the extra training he has done and the data he has been gathering on tezuka since their freshman years as tezuka continues to struggle against inuis data tennis inui manages to return one of tezukas difficult drop shots however tezuka reveals uses a technique that shocks both his opponent and the spectators  
tezuka uses the tezuka zone a technique which controls the spin of the ball so it will always return to him and his zero-shiki drop shot a shot that rolls backward once it falls on the ground to defeat inui meanwhile momoshiro disappears and temporarily leaves the team causing anxiety within the whole team when discussing momoshiros recent leave oishi and eiji get into an argument when eiji makes some insensitive remarks causing a division in the golden pair when they separate to play a doubles match with kaido and ryoma

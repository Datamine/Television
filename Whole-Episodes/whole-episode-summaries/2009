after the fight between ichigo kurosaki and grimmjow jaegerjaques concludes when ichigo breaks through grimmjows strongest attack grimmjow attempts to continue the fight but is attacked by nnoitra gilga an espada however ichigo protects grimmjow as ichigo and nnoitra begin to fight tesla nnoitras subordinate captures orihime inoue nnoitra reveals that he is the fifth espada and is stronger than grimmjow meanwhile renji abarai uryū ishida pesche guatiche and dondochakka bilstin attempt to flee the espada szayel aporro granz but because szayel aporro controls the building they are in he redirects the hallways to point back towards their battlefield  
nnoitra overpowers the tired ichigo and when orihime attempts to help tesla threatens to destroy her hairclips the source of her power which would allow her to stop tesla szayel aporro releases his zanpakutō and creates clones of renji uryū pesche and dondochakka furthermore he releases the power limiter in the room to allow renji and uryū to fight at full power meanwhile nnoitra encounters nel and recognizes her when ichigo asks how he knows nel nnoitra reveals nels true name is neliel tu odelschwanck indicating that she is a former espada  
nnoitra uses nel as a shield against ichigo whom he pins to the ground as he prepares to break ichigos arm the intensity of nels emotions causes her to return to her original adult form neliel pesche and dondochakka realize that nel has transformed into her original form and feel nostalgic neliel takes ichigo away from the battlefield and as she prepares to fight nnoitra she reveals that she was the former third espada she overpowers nnoitra and in desperation nnoitra uses a cero blast neliel uses her cero doble technique to absorb nnoitras cero and redirect it at him with doubled force however nnoitra is relatively unharmed and reveals that the espada have grown stronger in her absence  
uryū and renji struggle to fight their clones as they copy their attacks renji uses his bankai and the clones copy him destroying the building in response szayel aporro destroys the clones and uses another ability of his released form to create voodoo dolls of his opponents using the dolls he causes pain to his targets and damages their internal organs meanwhile nnoitra and neliel fight each other to a stalemate and nnoitra states that he despised neliel even during her time as an espada  
nnoitra recalls his past encounters with neliel in which neliel sparred with nnoitra and easily defeated him in one session nnoitra demanded that she continue the fight until one of them died and neliel refused as a result nnoitra attacked neliels subordinates pesche and dondochakka and with szayel aporros aid paralyzed neliel long enough for him to land an attack on her he left her outside aizens palace where she transformed into an amnesiac child in which pesche and dondochakka vowed to protect her in the present nnoitra taunts neliel about their past and neliel prepares to release her zanpakutō  
neliel finishes her release transforming into a white centaur and overwhelms nnoitra meanwhile pesche and dondochakka begin to fight szayel aporro and use cero sincrético a combination attack fusing their cero blasts to attack szayel however szayel aporro nullifies the attack and reveals that he had already analyzed their spiritual energy when neliel attempts to finish off nnoitra she transforms back into her child form ichigo tries to help nel and nnoitra allows tesla to fight him after releasing his zanpakutō tesla starts to torture the exhausted ichigo before tesla can deal the final blow soul reaper captain kenpachi zaraki stops him  
kenpachi defeats tesla in one blow and tells ichigo to stay out of his fight with nnoitra he informs ichigo that kisuke urahara was tasked with making the garganta gateways into hueco mundo stable enough for soul reaper captains to enter and that three other captains came with him captain retsu unohana arrives with her lieutenant isane kotetsu and they stop rudbornn chelute and the exequias from killing yasutora chad sado and gantenbainne mosqueda captain mayuri kurotsuchi and his lieutenant nemu kurotsuchi arrive mayuri is confident that he can win against szayel aporro even after szayel aporro creates a voodoo doll of him captain byakuya kuchiki arrives to save rukia kuchiki from espada zommari leroux and overcomes zommaris enhanced speed with the techniques yoruichi shihōin taught him  
after realizing that byakuya refuses to treat him as an equal opponent zommari releases his zanpakutō and grows on his body eyes that can control the objects they are looking at zommari takes control of byakuyas arm and leg and byakuya cuts his own tendons to stop them from moving meanwhile byakuya orders hanatarō yamada to take rukia to safety zommari uses one of his eyes to control rukia and has her slice hanatarō with her sword before byakuya can interfere he threatens to force her to commit suicide byakuya immobilizes rukia with kidō and uses his bankai surrounded by thousands of tiny blades zommari is overwhelmed by the attack  
zommari survives byakuyas attack but byakuya uses kidō to block zommaris control ability and quickly dispatches him mayuri initially seems unable to fight back against szayel aporro who uses his voodoo doll ability to destroy all of mayuris organs however he reveals that he has made himself immune to szayel aporros attack by replacing the organs in his body with dummies after learning about the ability from bacteria he implanted in uryū to use the voodoo doll he then activates his bankai which poisons szayel aporro and subsequently swallows him  
rukia regains consciousness and byakuya tells her to rest and regain her strength for the impending battles kenpachi battles nnoitra and orihime heals nel at ichigos request while swallowing szayel aporro with his bankai mayuri inadvertently poisons uryū and renji and szayel aporro seizes the opportunity to resurrect himself by absorbing nemus spiritual particles through his gabriel technique however in the process he ingests a superhuman drug from inside nemu that increases all of his senses to the point where his body cannot respond to the flood of sensory information immobilizing him with mayuri stating that one second would feel like a century he then stabs szayel aporro through the hand before stabbing him in the heart  
szayel aporro whose senses are heightened by the drug feels mayuris zanpakutō piercing through his hand and heart for what he feels as centuries before he dies after restoring nemu to full health mayuri orders her to clear away the rubble that concealed szayel aporros laboratory afterwards mayuri heals uryūs injuries meanwhile kenpachi has difficulty cutting through nnoitras skin which nnoitra claims is the toughest of any of the espada but believes that nnoitra can be injured kenpachi stabs nnoitra through his eye patch but nnoitra counterattacks injuring kenpachi he then reveals that kenpachi had stabbed him through his hollow hole which is where his left eye should have been  
kenpachi slashes at nnoitra wounding him and uses the correct amount of force he needed to cut nnoitras skin he continues to attack nnoitra and after nnoitra accidentally tears off kenpachis eye patch while trying to attack him the limits on his power are removed kenpachi delivers a slash through nnoitras torso nnoitra releases his zanpakutō and gains an additional pair of arms nnoitra attacks kenpachi and severely wounds him while kenpachi manages to cut off one of his arms nnoitra regenerates the arm and continues on the assault growing another pair of arms and stabbing kenpachi with one of his hands  
kenpachi continues fighting nnoitra and although he is able to keep up with his attacks he realizes that he is in danger of dying he then resorts to using kendo and severely injures nnoitra with a two-handed strike kenpachi attempts to leave but nnoitra insists that he finish their battle nnoitra recalls his time with neliel in which neliel frequently saved him from his attempts to die in battle and claims that he is angered by any display of pity from his opponent he charges kenpachi who inflicts the finishing blow  
after kenpachi defeats nnoitra the espada coyote starrk and lilynette gingerbuck arrive and carry orihime away to a tower where sōsuke aizen greets her he informs her that he gin ichimaru and kaname tōsen are preparing to destroy karakura town aizen orders tōsen to contact the soul reaper captains ichigo and his friends with kidō and reveals that he brought orihime to hueco mundo to lure and trap them while he travels through a garganta portal to karakura town however commander-general genryūsai shigekuni yamamoto the leader of the thirteen court guard squads confronts aizen with five other captains aizen summons the espadas starrk and lilynette barragan louisenbairn and tia harribel and orders espada ulquiorra cifer to protect las noches ichigo sensing the threat to orihime flies off to save her

six months after the season 3 finale dexter is now living with three kids and a wife in a new home along with his new son harrison the complexities of being a suburban father of three is making it difficult for dexter to concentrate on his work dexters lack of sleep results in a murderer being released because dexter brought the wrong case file to court a recently retired agent lundy has returned to finally capture a shadowy serial killer known as the trinity killer john lithgow who has been at large for 30 years and always kills three people every year after a call from rita dexter quickly kills the released murderer but totals his car after falling asleep at the wheel 
suffering from amnesia following his car crash dexter begins searching for benny gomezs lost body with a helping hand from harry debra struggles with the return of her former lover while quinn tries to juggle his personal and work life meanwhile the trinity killer begins stalking his next chosen victim 
when a local vandal begins stirring up trouble dexters neighborhood becomes vigilant and wary two things dexter doesnt need his mobility is also hampered by rita who insists on driving him around after his accident debra is upset when anton announces hes taken a local job to spend more time with her meanwhile the trinity killer dispatches his next victim debra becomes drawn to lundys theories about trinity while dexter finds himself in awe of trinitys masterful killing technique despite their enthusiasm laguerta threatens to shut down the investigation instead focused on bringing the vacation murderers to justice 
while rita and the kids are out of town for a wedding a police officer christina cox comes onto dexters radar the officer is a kindred spirit and highly suspicious of dexters motives laguerta and angel discuss full disclosure to the higher brass pulling dexter unwillingly into the middle of their problem meanwhile quinns reporter girlfriend christine courtney ford uses their relationship to put out a story how lundys hunt for a phantom killer pulls time away from the vacation murders this puts a strain on lundys retirement project when his visitors pass to miami metro is revoked having to take the project out of the office old sparks heat up between lundy and debra 
recent events spur dexter into his own investigation of the trinity killer his motivations are now personal and the clock is ticking but the closer dexter gets the more he realizes that trinity is unlike any monster hes previously encountered meanwhile debra blames herself for events that were out of her control and in doing so pushes away those closest to her as laguerta and batista close in on the vacation murderers batista realizes he can use quinns relationship with a certain reporter to his advantage and when rita discovers a secret dexters been keeping from her she begins to realize just how little she knows about the man she married 
dexter knows its only a matter of time before miami metro discovers the trinity killers latest handiwork therefore he has to work doubly hard to stay one step ahead of their investigation under the alias of kyle butler dexter has begun to realize that the closer he gets to trinity the more he stands to learn from this very different beast as the friendly building contractor arthur mitchell the trinity killer hides behind a well-kept mask and getting behind that facade will require some extra prodding on dexters part meanwhile debra becomes frustrated when she finds herself shut out from her own case she considers bending the rules in the name of justice risking her career in the process laguerta and batista come to regret a major decision and realize that by playing by the rules they may have painted themselves into a corner and when the friction between rita and dexter comes to a head dexter gleans relationship advice from a most unlikely source 
a dismembered human arm is found inside an alligator leading dexter to his next victim jonathan farrow a photographer who shoots fairly gruesome pictures of models apparently killing latina models who were in america illegally ensuring no missing persons reports would be filed family and work taking its toll a hurried dexter accidentally makes his greatest single mistake and violates the code of harry meanwhile arthur mitchell appears to be disturbed and is unable to put a doe out of its misery after hitting it with his car he then proceeds to build a coffin with lumber he obtained with dexters help in order to get more alone time dexter acting upon arthurs advice attempts to involve his kids in more activities only to get pulled into the activities with them after threatening quinn to keep his girlfriend reporter away from deb quinn starts digging into dexters past and makes his life a lot more difficult 
dexter has always known his fathers code was meant to protect him from exposure but after committing a serious mistake he wonders if it could have been designed to protect him from something even more dangerous - human emotion when he discovers that arthur is planning an out-of-town trip dexter sees an opportunity to ride along and gain insight into the mind of a fellow monster even so dexter isnt prepared for the startling revelations arthur makes along the way revelations about his own past which only serve to convince dexter of what he must do meanwhile back at miami metro debra refuses to let a technicality keep her off the trinity case she works through others to ensure her voice is heard - that is until she realizes that her single-minded pursuit of the trinity killer may have blinded her to the truth 
for most people thanksgiving is a time for traditions and family but for dexter its an opportunity to get closer to his most dangerous adversary yet as dexter gains insight into arthurs psychology by studying those closest to him he finds himself drawn into a bizarre and twisted world meanwhile rita has her hands full preparing dinner for a packed house including a few unexpected guests batista gets closure on an old case while debra uses the holiday to continue her investigation of the trinity killer a pursuit which threatens her brothers safety and brings to light surprising revelations about someone else close to her 
dexter finally believes he understands the beast arthur mitchell known as the trinity killer but when a ten-year-old boy jake short goes missing dexter is forced to question everything hes learned up to this point its a race against the clock to find the boy before trinity kills him and with each step forward dexter has to confront the real possibility that he may have more in common with trinity than hed like to admit secrets abound - from cody who is forced to defend one of dexters lies masuka who cant bring himself to confess what he witnessed at thanksgiving and debra whose recent discoveries force one of miamis finest into making an impossible decision 
dexters worst fears have been realized because of debras unrelenting pursuit miami metro is just one step away from discovering the identity of the trinity killer and dexter cant let that happen arthurs arrest would not only deprive dexter of a satisfying kill it would also expose the secret life dexters been leading as kyle butler in his pursuit of this monster dexter must take drastic action to buy himself time to deal with trinity in his own fashion meanwhile rita decides to confide in dexter which doesnt go as well as shed hoped laguerta and batistas breach of ethics paints them into a very tight corner and arthur who still cant understand why dexter didnt simply turn him in begins his own bloody investigation into kyle butler 
as the noose tightens arthur warns dexter to back off but dexter will do anything to stop arthur from eluding him even if that means putting himself on the wrong side of the law rita acknowledges the rocky relationship she and dexter share but reaffirms her support meanwhile batista and laguerta face the consequences of their actions and now that they are married agree to move in together debra finally learns that dexter is the ice-truck killers brother and tells dexter she then tells him he is the only constant truly good thing in her life and that she loves him at the culmination of the episode dexter finally captures and kills arthur but then goes home to find rita dead apparently killed by arthur hours earlier in the same manner as the other trinity bathtub victims and harrison alive sitting in a pool of ritas blood

a heroic family reaches across the border to give to others—while letting their own house sit unfinished 
twelve years ago maria ruiz and her family of el paso texas committed themselves to feeding the poor across the border in juarez mexico and helping their local community 
it’s inspirational for us to hear that maria and her husband jesus travel across the border every day bringing food clothing and supplies to thousands between them the two work multiple jobs in order to do this work—and in fact maria was recently named one of the “top ten cnn heroes of 2008” for all of her foundation work 
we come to see that there has been a trade-off for all of this dedicated work to others—the ruiz family home sits unfinished the construction that began over 12 years ago was stopped dead for the charitable work—as all resources and family efforts have been directed to helping others instead as a result we’re shocked to see the house tilting in on itself the exposed plywood floors cracks in floors and walls and to top it all off the house lacks heat 
additionally the food bank work has taken over the house—but the living room is overflowing due to lack of storage and the kitchen itself is woefully inadequate 
due to the ruiz family’s spirit thousands of starving people have been able to eat now it’s up to ty the designers and hundreds of blue-shirted volunteers to help give back to them tony little “america’s personal trainer” also stops in to help lend a hand to this project

the cerda’s scenario is an extraordinary one their two daughters suffer from such a severe immune deficiency that their house itself is a life-threatening danger 
molly and maggie cerda were each diagnosed with combined immune deficient disease cidd when they were just three years old this disease is so intense that even a simple cold can be a disaster we can’t even begin to imagine what it’d be like to have to stay inside to avoid germs at all costs and often even wear masks in our own homes 
both of their parents are strong community supporters—their father chuck works for homeland security while terri their mother has worked all her life in global relief—organizing search and rescue dog services for worldwide disaster additionally you discover that terri has founded “artful hearts” a group which helps improve the lives of sick children by painting murals in clinics and hospitals trying to bring cheer to those undergoing treatments we’re surprised to find that terri has also found the time to be a patient advocate for the immune deficiency foundation and has met with senators to influence laws governing medications 
this family has given so much to their community and yet struggled with their own home we see the details of how their house was unknowingly in poor condition when they first bought it and through a series of floods severe water damage set in we find it heartbreaking to hear that structural engineers had advised them to gut the house and rebuild—thankfully ty and the designers have arrived to give a lending hand 
however in 2011 it was discovered that terri cerda has münchausen syndrome by proxy and that molly and maggie cerda are totally healthy and have no health problems whatsoever child protective services in oregon became involved and testified in court against terri cerda to have her daughters taken away from her 
 
through the power of books one man aims to spark the imagination of the local kids in his community but we discover that he and his own boys are residing in appalling conditions 
our special two-part season finale takes us to indianapolis indiana where we meet another everyday hero bernard mcfarland whose deteriorating house will be rebuilt from the ground up—with help from ty and the gang and a strong cast of blue-shirted volunteers 
we learn that starting when he was young librarian bernard learned the power of books and the weight of words although he grew up poor and overcame obstacles that we can’t begin to imagine he graduated from college joined the military and later returned home to his three sons 
back in indianapolis bernard was determined not to accept the troubled community around him his mission to reduce both the rising violence in the neighborhood and the number of kids dropping out of school we discover that he founded pack house 2000 a program dedicated to expanding dreams of youngsters by forming reading groups and organizing field trips to libraries museums and cultural events throughout the city all of this we learn he managed to make happen with very limited resources 
we see throughout the episode that bernard is an important part of his community but has been unable to take care of his own home we shudder at seeing the holes throughout the ceilings walls and floors the water damage in the sub-flooring and the rusting pipes corroded wiring and crumbling drywall and our hearts can’t help but to go out to his three boys who all share one room 
we don’t know about you but our spirits sure soar as we watch designer paul dimeo shoot hoops with the indiana pacers who make a special donation and as we see this special house come together for an inspiring father who has helped so many realize their own dreams

while running home late from a job ichigo encounters a supposed vampire who runs off when she sees a pin otome gave her this vampire is revealed to be otomes classmate yurika tōdō who constantly acts in character in preparation for a loli-goth themed audition for a rock festival which ichigo also intends to participate in feeling she needs to make a character for herself too ichigo starts dressing up like frankensteins bride the next day yurika ends up causing a fire in her dorm room while using aroma candles to fit her character with ichigo rushing in to recover her umbrella before naoto puts out the fire after the incident yurika gives ichigo and the others her thanks and shows them her normal side as a regular girl wearing glasses who likes vampires as the day of the audition comes ichigo decides to face against yurika using her own brand and despite not winning the audition feels proud of her efforts  
an article appears in the tabloids features photos that expose yurikas normal appearance that she keeps secret from the public ichigo and the others suggest that she might be able to overcome it she obtains some premium cards for the rock festival however yurika becomes downhearted believing she will lose the fans who loved her vampire personality wanting to cheer her up ichigo shows yurika some of her fans that were hiding outside of her dorm who still believe in her regaining her confidence yurika and the others go to meet the loli gothics head designer maya yumekouji who lives in a rather spooky mansion after the others help her get through the scary trials yurika reaches maya who acknowledges yurikas desire to become stronger and gives her some premium cards after pulling out a stellar performance at the rock festival yurika returns to her good old self  
ichigo ran otome and yurika are given the chance to audition for a movie remake of stylish thief ☆ swallowtail a show which previously starred masquerade the idol pair orihime was a part of as the gang train for the audition yurika chooses not to in order to keep with her vampire character upon arriving at the audition the girls are tasked with recovering a card that was stolen from a holographic mizuki from a booby trap filled castle where ichigo and otomes hasty movements cause trouble for ran and yurika although yurika manages to help the gang get past a group of guards her lack of training makes itself noticeable when she has to dodge security lasers as the girls soon reach the escape phase of their audition they end up having to fight their way past aoi and shion onto a hot air balloon when the balloon suddenly starts to descend ichigo and otome decide to get off to lighten the balloon shortly joined by ran and yurika who decide to join them as the audition comes to a close they each receive a mark of acting in their aikatsu phones including aoi while ichigo and otome are chosen for the roles in the movie  
the gang decide to go undercover so they can watch ichigo and otomes movie in a normal movie theater after the movie they come across ringo and raichi who points out how idols have a particular scent to them which aoi later explains to be an idols aura as ichigo becomes worried that she might not have an idol aura herself she aoi and ran are informed of a concert theyll be appearing in due to the attention theyve garnered from their recent work later ichigo appears in a radio interview and is initially overcome with nerves but gets some assurance from the host during the show ichigo reads out a letter by raichi the answer of which projects her aura out of the radio to her fans ichigo soon comes to realise aura isnt something you can consciously exude but is something that flows naturally from her idol activities after the concert goes without a hitch orihime makes plans for ran to participate in a special audition held by spicy ageha  
as ran trains for the representative audition for spicy ageha ichigo applies her to appear in a fashion show for the senior students graduation ceremony ran states that in order to become a representative she will have to outperform third year student ema shinjou ran ends up losing the audition to ema with orihime saying while her audition was spot-on she doesnt yet have what it takes to become the brands muse ran starts pushing herself to train believing she isnt suited for the fashion show audition noticing her funk orihime takes ran to the third year classrooms to teach her the true meaning of being a muse to inspire designers to design for her receiving some new aikatsu cards for everyone ran joins the others in the fashion show before seeing off ema as she graduates  
after finishing up their auditions for a while ichigo aoi and ran decide to go to some hot springs for their time off along the way they encounter some fans have conversations on the train and stop by a field of flowers to enjoy a picnic however after taking a lengthy nap after eating they find theyve missed all the buses to the hot springs meaning they have to walk back to the station luckily they encounter another fan who gives them a ride to the station and despite not getting to go to the hot springs the girls enjoy the day they have spent together on the ride home ichigo receives word that her father is returning home  
ichigos father taichi arrives home on april fools day bringing with him some star grapes that he acquired during his travels hearing hell be around for the spring vacation ichigo invites him to view one of her auditions before taking him to the academy to meet her friends where he talks more wild tales which aoi and the others pass off as an april fools prank later that night taichi receives a call from his colleagues calling him back to work to negotiate with a tribe about the star grapes working as quickly as he can taichi manages to make it back to japan in time for ichigos audition as the tribe elder urged him to head back and keep his daughters promise after the audition ichigo sees tacihi off as he heads back on his travels  
as a new school year arrives and ichigo and the others move up a year the now second year students are assigned to help mentor the new freshmen ichigo is assigned to a freshman named sakura kitaoji whose grandfather helped train mizuki however her twin brother sakon doesnt approve of her enrolling in starlight academy and living on her own after an awkward spat between siblings ichigo begins training sakura for a freshman fashion show audition when ichigo feels that sakura is worrying about something she gets some advice from mizuki and comes to realise that sakura is anxious due to being apart from her brother realising this ichigo gets help from naoto to light up a cherry blossom tree outside of sakuras dorm assuring her that shes never alone after the audition sakon expresses his praise for how well sakura handled things on her own  
the fresh girls cup is announced in which students get the chance to challenge mizuki for the title of starlight queen ran who competed the previous year before ichigo and aoi transferred in explains how remarkable mizuki is for facing off against every single student stating it will be tough to beat her and all of their rivals this year mizuki throws in a new rule that performers will have to perform three special appeals on demand or otherwise fail pushing the bar exceptionally high ichigo and the others soon start training intensely for the cup though ichigo feels there is something they are missing after receiving a call from raichi she comes to understand the most important thing to have fun and appeal to their fans on the day of the cup ichigo aoi ran otome yurika and sakura are grouped together to face mizuki though only ichigo aoi and ran manage to keep up with the special appeals until the end and qualify for the semifinals  
ichigo aoi and ran find themselves unable to sleep before the semi-finals and decide to have a sleepover in ichigos room reading mizukis new magazine for research they learn she has started her own brand love queen designed specifically for top idols as the girls take the magazines advice of undergoing individual training catered to their needs naoto helps ichigo realise the best way for her to train to act instead of think after the semi-finals come to an end only ichigo makes it to the final but aoi and ran continue to support her despite their losses before the final begins mizuki tells ichigo that she is using the cup to search for a worthy partner urging ichigo to give it everything shes got although she ends up in second place in the end later that night mizuki hints to ichigo that the gap between them may be smaller than she thinks  
as ichigo aoi and ran ponder on how they can catch up to mizuki they meet a first year named akane mimori who is an admirer of aoi with the girls wondering how to become more responsible upperclassmen orihime assigns them as teachers in which they must come up with ways to teach the freshmen about being an idol struggling to come up with lesson ideas the girls approach akane over what she would like to learn to which she expresses that shed like to hear about what they have experienced on the day of the lesson ran has trouble getting questions from the audience while ichigo forgets about teaching them altogether however aoi manages to stay focused and provide an insightful look into idol life gaining a lot of praise from the students as a reward the girls receive rare spring collection cards from orihime and put them to use in a show  
a special audition is being held where idols must form teams to try and earn the mastery of communication ichigo and the others invite sakura to join their team but she doesnt feel confident as she doesnt have any premium rare cards she tells them about her favorite brand aurora fantasy but doubts that she would be able to obtain premium cards from its top designer green grass as she doesnt feel they suit her as the others each do their part to try and help sakura otome goes to see makoto who is friends with green grass and receives a new happy rainbow premium dress conveying to sakura of how she doesnt want to lose to the amount of love she has for aurora fantasy her confidence renewed sakura goes to see green grass who is revealed to be a pair of twin sisters who give her a premium dress as thanks for all the letters she sent to them as a child after a successful audition of using call &amp response the girls earn their mastery of communication  
as mothers day approaches an audition is announced in which student pairs will be performing one of masquerades songs with the theme being nostalgic melody aoi puts everyone on a retro training regime but this fails to impress the dance teacher on mothers day ichigo and raichi help around the house so ringo can put her feet up while observing her cooking ichigo gets some advice from ringo on how to overcome her training wall ringo takes ichigo to an old stage where they used to sing as children as well as where she first met taichi after helping ichigo practise her dance routine ringo gives her an aikatsu accessory card the starlight tiara which she wears in her audition with aoi helping them to win  
as the gang are chosen for a newcomer idol event in which they decide on wearing matching brands ichigo is requested by angely sugars designer to appear in a commercial for their mascot angely bear however the scheduling for the commercial clashes with the training for the newcomer event but ichigo becomes determined to do both as she feels they are both very important while handling production meetings during the day ichigo trains for her performance during the night noticing her struggling to balance them properly aoi gets help from johnny and sakura to provide dance lesson videos for ichigo to use as a reference as ichigo feels bad about falling behind on her concert practice the designer tells her why she made the angely bears to bring smiles to people after finishing up her filming ichigo gets in some extra training with the others and performs well before everyone gets together to watch the finished commercial  
mizuki decides to hold an audition at starlight academy for two partners to form a new idol unit tristar with her as all the students spend the next week training the girls hear from aoi about how mizuki once tried a team audition shortly after becoming the starlight queen but failed due to her skill being far beyond her teammates the audition begins with an obstacle course with the idols first required to climb a steep wall which is made more difficult due to naoto spraying water everywhere eliminating the contestants down to fifty they next have to cross a balance beam while being bombarded with volleyballs followed by having to finish a song while riding a mechanical bull reducing the contestants to twenty after yurika gets eliminated due to keeping her character during a crawl against a giant fan eight idols remain for the concert stage which besides ichigo and the others include the three girls that entered the team audition with mizuki two years ago after the eight contestants perform mizuki announces that ichigo aoi ran and the three former teammates will compete in a final audition the next day just then a mysterious girl named kaede ichinose skydives in from above  
kaede who is a super idol in america manages to get a place in the final audition by showing she has done more extreme versions of the trials the other idols went through this leaves aoi and ran uneasy about their own auditions while ichigo wonders if there is something more to the audition than simply getting into tristar the girls decide to visit kaede where they learn how she became fascinated with magic after meeting the designer of her favorite brand magical toy kaede then explains to ichigo that even though the audition is for a place in tristar it is still a performance which she intends to make fun for the audience this encourages the others to do their best in entertaining their fans during their audition the next day following the audition mizuki chooses kaede as her first member but announces that ichigo aoi and ran must face off against each other in one more audition for the remaining place  
with the final audition approaching ichigo aoi and ran are told to spend the night living in separate rooms of a big mansion without their aikatsu phones after receiving special summer collection cards of their respective brands from orihime each girl is individually interviewed by mizuki each giving their own insight on why they would fit in tristar after the final audition takes place mizuki chooses ran to be the final member of tristar feeling that she has what it takes to stand on her own as well as perform as a team ichigo and aoi tearfully see ran off as she heads for a new life as a member of tristar  
as tristars schedule becomes busier ran becomes more isolated from ichigo and aoi who are saddened to hear ran is unable to return to the star academy dorms due to her schedule wanting to deliver a gift to her the girls try to arrange a meeting when tristars schedule conflicts with ichigos audition and aois filming in the same building ran becomes so anxious about being able to meet them that she makes some errors during her performance she ends up barely missing ichigo and aoi who leave her a gift and a motivational message however ran is still disheartened that she isnt living up to the expectations of mizuki and kaede meanwhile orihime has plans to start up another idol unit  
as tristar continue their success orihime announces that ichigo and aoi will form a new idol unit which they personally decide to name soleil meanwhile ran starts feeling lonely and after making a mistake during a performance and missing ichigo and aoi at a rehearsal she comes to realize that she is severely missing them this does not go unnoticed by mizuki who realized she has been stifling rans potential for her own goals after receiving a mail from mizuki ran rushes to soleils debut concert where she announces she has quit tristar so that she can shine brightly alongside ichigo and aoi as a member of soleil  
with soleil now a three-girl group aoi and ran decide ichigo should be the leader meanwhile otome decides to form her own idol unit with sakura and shion powa powa puririn while mizuki takes an interest in yurika while initially struggling with what leader she should try and become ichigo gets some inspiration from a strawberry parfait being a leader that relies on her team mates as much as they rely on her mizuki eventually reveals that she has chosen yurika as the third member of tristar followed by an announcement that tristar and soleil will perform together in concert later that night ran meets up with yurika to pass on her former uniform then the next day after soleils performance johnny praised ichigo as the leader although the day before he said ichigo will cause chaos and after both have done their performances orihime mentioned how many units will formed one after another soon including powapowa puririn  
orihime arranges for soleil to perform a concert at a local open-air stage in ichigos hometown the catch however is that they must fill every seat without using television or the internet otherwise the event will be called off the girls jog throughout town spreading awareness of their concert to the townsfolk including adults who may not have heard of soleil after stopping by ringos restaurant the girls help deliver some groceries to an old lady who helps spread word of the concert to her elderly friends who in turn provide more opportunities to promote themselves building up to a large following although there is one seat left remaining ichigo manages to plead with johnny to let the concert go ahead so they dont disappoint their fans as the girls perform the concert manages to pull even more fans than they needed proving to be a complete success afterwards orihime reveals that soleil and tristar will perform together in a summer tour as a combined unit star☆anis  
soleil have to make the announcement about star☆anis tour without the tristar due to a flight delay but aoi manages to handle things until a live feed goes up orihime also makes a surprise announcement that powa powa puririn will be joining star☆anis as well as the soleil girls realise they need to practise for a special audition for the mastery of dance aoi hears about a new futuring girl premium dress and arranges a meeting with the top designer while waiting to hear back from orihime about the meeting aoi tells ran about how she first became friends with ichigo after meeting her at a festival aoi then hears from orihime that they may have to cancel the futuring girl dress announcement as the top designer rei has locked himself in a shell so aoi is sent to try to get him out aoi decides to tell him more about her first meeting with ichigo and how she set her on the path to becoming an idol expressing how much futuring girl means to her moved by this rei comes out of his shell and gives aoi the premium dress the audition goes well and ichigo aoi and ran each earn the mastery of dance  
as powa powa puririn give a press conference about their involvement with star☆anis shion states she will not join star☆anis in order to focus on her acting career as the girls head off to begin their tour aoi is put in charge of star☆anis publicity following their first rehearsal as a combined unit the girls grow concerned that an approaching typhoon may cause problems for their performance though some tension is relieved as mizuki joins them for the night although the weather clears up by the morning and the tour goes on ahead the typhoon ends up damaging one of the electric pylons causing a blackout in the stadium that leaves the aikatsu system unusable not wishing to disappoint their fans the girls go out on stage and do a variety performance to buy time for the staff to get a backup generator online allowing the performance to go ahead

as the star☆anis members return to their individual units shion is preparing for an audition for the role of alice in a production of alice in wonderland however having mostly played cool stoic roles shion worries that she wont be able to give off a dazzling smile fitting for the role of alice on the day of her audition shion is surprised to find ichigo had been cast as the white rabbit at the request of orihime with aoi and ran and all her other friends cast in various roles despite the pressure of needing to keep in character regardless of the surprises shion finds herself having a lot of fun reaching the final scene shion cheerfully states her dream of becoming an actress giving off a dazzling smile that wins the director over earning her the part  
a musician named king from naos band more than true appears at star academys gates telling ichigo to pass on a message that he will never approve of naos music after the message is passed on nao simply states it is between them and reminds ichigo not to tell anyone hes in a band after stuffing her cheeks to keep herself from blabbing to aoi and ran ichigo follows nao to a music studio where she finds her arguing with his bandmates hiro and shurato over king quitting the band ichigo learns from nao that after more than true became popular king became frustrated with nao only writing songs that would sell and decided to quit the band as nao laments his indecisiveness king overheards their conversation and apologises though stands by his feeling that their songs should be for their fans with the direction of the band still in question ichigo suggests they attend one of soleils concerts to show them there is no such thing as a fan you cant see inspired by this more than true resumes their activities

josh and nora awake nude in the woods after a full moon unsure of the events the night before in a flashback to 24 hours earlier aidan and josh are preparing to leave for work when they realize that strange things are happening and believe sally is losing control of her abilities but she claims it is not her but some poltergeist come to bother her at the hospital josh finds nora who is still conflicted over what happened josh reveals she hurt him by leaving without any answer and mentions that the twins said they were in contact with her which they were not elsewhere in the hospital aidan is approached by atlee of the dutch who believes aidan knows something about heggemans disappearance back at the house sally continues to see the effects of the poltergeist and when she ascends the stairs it attacks her with the threatening voice of danny she goes to see aidan at the hospital wondering if danny is somehow behind the reapers appearance but they soon discover that danny was murdered in prison aidan tells her to use iron to disperse dannys essence and assures her that she is the stronger ghost if he is truly the reaper and then confronts josh about cecilias sudden disappearance josh reveals that cecilia did help him and in exchange he told her that the twins killed heggeman when he finally gets cecilias phone to pick up connor is on the other line revealing that they have captured cecilia and want to have a showdown with aidan in the woods that night a full moon aidan tells atlee that he knows the where the purebred wolves who killed heggeman are and have him come along to save cecilia and get revenge elsewhere nora and josh have a fight as nora and the twins believe cecilia was sent by aidan to kill the twins and she goes to the woods to change with the twins at the house sally has her showdown with danny who reveals his ghostly form while sally believes she has the upper hand dannys death in prison has taught him more in a short period of time and overpowers her until the reaper appears to kill dannys spirit before taking on a more corporeal form the reaper tells sally that she is an aberration in the natural order as she passed over her door and he has come to remove her from existence but dannys death has given her more time josh goes to a shed in the woods where nora and the twins are preparing for the full moon but josh is surprised when aidan arrives as the twins have brought him for a vampire hunt josh reveals that he was the one who gave the twins location to cecilia which surprises nora and the twins as josh and nora start to transform aidan retreats into the woods to inform atlee that they will have to face four werewolves instead of two and atlee retreats josh nora and the twins hunt aidan through the woods until he manages to find cecilia and heggemans rifle as the rifle has no ammunition and cecilia is too weak to be of any help to aidan she pleads with him to leave her behind so he may be safe he lets her down and makes his escape as the werewolves tear cecilia apart sally meets up with the reaper again who realizes that she is a special case but the order must be restored and she should say her goodbyes the next morning josh and nora wake and noras revelation that she likes being the wolf more and does not want the cure josh truly wants leads to their breakup they meet up with the twins with connor amazed that josh tried to kill them when aidan returns and uses heggemans rifle to shoot connor with a silver bullet killing him as he reverts to his wolf form brynn breaks down in tears at the death of her brother as aidan leaves with connors body to present to atlee so he may say he is the one who took revenge for heggemans death so long as he never returns to boston josh and aidan return to the house where sally wants to tell them about the reaper but they are in no mood to talk leaving sally ready to leave without saying goodbye 
it has been a week since the events of the full moon sally is on edge as the reaper has not sought her out to shred her but he appears to her to give her an ultimatum as he has found a loophole sally can either be reaped or become the new reaper josh has been out of work for the past week in a slump since the breakup with nora aidan however has called in emily to cheer josh up when sally asks aidan for advice on the reaper he suggests she shred him before he gets the chance to shred her emily plans joshs recovery from the breakup saying that the two of them should go out drinking sally goes to see stevie to ask his advice on how to shred ghosts but he warns her that shredding makes ghosts dark and it is not something she wants to do aidan meets with suren who is upset that cecilia has been killed suren also reveals that mother will be making a trip to boston to check on her progress but she has lied to her and said that bishops orphans have been culled so they must take care of them aidan hunts down henry to warn him finding him at the house of a human who offers passage across the threshold in exchange for money aidan tells henry to gather all of the orphans at the house because he has found a way to save them and henry josh leaves work early as the hospital reminds him too much of nora and catches up with emily at the bar where he finds she has been hanging out with julia still not ready to face his ex-fiancée josh orders drinks which is out of character for him as the night goes on sally ultimately faces the reaper managing to shred him before he can do the same to her however the reaper quickly reforms his spiritual form surprised that sally had the gall to attack him but also instilling the exhilaration in her of being a reaper realizing she has no way out she takes on his offer to be a reaper and he takes her out on her first assignment elsewhere the orphans gather at henrys beckoning where aidan promises them that they will have safe passage to baltimore where the vampire society has no hold however the owner of the house is brought in front of suren who offers to buy the house from him for a large sum of money he agrees and her living lawyer takes ownership of the house aidan and henry quickly trap the orphans in the basement and escape the house as the lawyer uninvites the vampires from his new house causing the orphans to turn to ash henry is upset but aidan reminds him that this is the only way to end his exile at the bar julia throws insults at josh feeling somehow relieved at his worse situation until emily needs to be taken home as she has drunk too much and hit on a straight girl at julias apartment after they put emily to bed julia realizes she has come to boston to find josh and to find answers josh tells her as much of the truth as possible without revealing his transformation into a werewolf saying he did not want to hurt her and leaves the apartment to head back home the reaper takes sally to stevie saying that he has been shredding too many ghosts and is stalking his former bully to shred him once he dies and that he must be reaped sally upset that she will have to reap her best friend tries to talk to stevie to find a way out of him being reaped but when he admits he will shred his former bully sally realizes she cannot help him and the reaper shreds him aidan presents henry to suren who is ready to take out revenge for what he did 80 years prior by flaying him alive aidan tells henry this is the only way he can re-enter vampire society and leaves him in surens hands the next day aidan sees that sally is still on this plane of existence and josh sees emily off but not before she tells him he missed his chance to have angry and drunk make-up sex with julia 
aidan takes henry back to the house so he may be able to recover from being skinned alive by suren while josh and sally go off to their respective jobs sally and the reaper discuss her new duties which begins with shredding walter a ghost from zoes support group after he starts possessing again she is not yet ready so the reaper takes matters into his own hands at the hospital josh and julia have some small talk as they were better friends than future spouses until josh sees his old friend stu who did not survive the werewolf attack years ago stu has been living as a ghost in ithaca and has come to see josh who he knows is a werewolf sally returns to the house after meeting with the reaper to find boner who the reaper told her was shredded by stevie she goes to zoe and nick for advice and they say she should come to the support group for help at the hospital with stus assistance josh and julia begin to rekindle their relationship during a required sexual harassment seminar at the house aidan has brought two willing young women to bring henry back to health using his mental powers to make them believe henry is not missing his skin so henry may feed without killing them this brings back memories of when they first met in 1918 france when henry was an allied powers medic and still alive and aidan was a soldier who miraculously survived a german attack while the attending physician tells henry not to give aidan morphine and leave him to die aidan orders henry to remove the bullets from his body healing quickly as time passes when an injured french soldier comes to the field hospital aidan drinks the blood from his discarded wound dressings but not without the french soldier seeing him he begins to rant and rave that aidan is a vampire but henry protects aidans identity until the french soldier tries to stake aidan henry intervenes in the scuffle until he is staked aidan drinks from his blood before wiping out the entire field hospital save for henry who he sires into a vampire and saves a survivor for him to be his first kill josh and julia meet at a bar where julia asks if they should become intimate stu pushes josh not to follow through and josh leaves until he apparently has a change of mind they return to julias apartment where it is revealed that stu has possessed josh to make love to julia josh awakes in the night and confronts stu about what he did realizing that stu has only come to boston to follow her now josh can either break her heart or put her in danger around the full moon when julia awakens to find josh by himself she curls up next to him and josh ultimately chooses to stay with her sally heads to the support group but she finds that the reaper has shredded all of the ghosts before she could make it she tries to talk to zoe but zoe fears her for reasons she does not understand back at the house aidans mental suggestion to the two girls starts to wear off and they see the blood covering them and henry aidan decides to kill both of them and henry takes his fill the next day josh returns to the house to find henry with his skin and aidan overseeing movers taking away two large boxes dripping with blood angering josh when he realizes what has happened inside nick approaches sally saying he will find a way to help her while she is struggling to salt herself in to protect herself from the reaper which suddenly appears to attack nick for falling in love with a living person sally yells at the reaper to leave nick alone and proclaims she will never be like him until the reaper takes her appearance and says she is already him sally flashes back to when tony told her that the longer ghosts stay on the living plane they begin to lose connection with reality she then realizes that the reaper is only a manifestation of her dark side and she has been the one responsible for all of the reapers shreddings aidan and josh come into the house just as sally shreds nick and then proceeds to attack the boys until aidan uses an iron fire poker to disperse her essence the two trap her in a ring of salt on the staircase and when she awakes she proceeds to scream at them in a demonic voice to let her go 
aidan and josh try to figure out what to do with sally who has fallen into a catatonic state since the reaper took over as aidan has never encountered something like this in the past they decide to seek out zoes help even though sally has just shredded nick zoe is reluctant at first as she watched sally shred all of her ghosts but aidan pleads with her to help and she agrees upon learning the full story she realizes that sallys subconscious has created the reaper as a form of feeling guilty for passing up her door and this entity has taken hold of sally inside sallys mind she is living out a fantasy where she is still alive and she is living in the house with her fiancé scott the reaper personality as sally is preparing breakfast she sees joshs reflection in a microwave but she cannot remember him meanwhile scott is continuously pushing her that they should move out of the house an attempt to make sure his personality will overwrite sallys aidan and joshs attempts to contact sally while she is out cold anger scott deciding to trap them all in the house and once he puts sally in bed in her mind making her think she is ill she takes control of sallys ghostly body he first taunts them bringing up aidans murders and joshs breakup with nora before revealing to zoe that nick has been shredded aidan is beginning to feel the effects of live blood withdrawal and zoe is tempting him and it is also the night of the full moon if sally is not saved zoe will be killed by one of the housemates the two try to push zoe to save sally even if they are all trapped together but her insistence that she will not help forces the two to reveal their supernatural natures zoe attempts a mind meld with sally hoping that by contacting sallys mind she will be able to free herself as their consciousnesses merge zoe falls limp she finds herself at sally and scotts engagement party where she does her best to convince sally that she is living in a fantasy and that scott is not who he seems to try to convince her zoe reminds sally that she has shredded nick but nick is alive and well in her fantasy in the house josh tries to find a way to shift in the house without killing either zoe or aidan but aidan cannot hold back and begins feeding on zoe until josh tears him away he then offers up his blood to aidan to drink from to keep zoe alive and after some hesitation he drinks from josh feeling an immediate buzz from the werewolf blood until he starts to convulse in pain in sallys mind zoe is beginning to get through to her as sally remembers nicks drowning death until scott attacks zoe it is not until aidan lets out a ghastly scream from his body violently rejecting joshs blood that sallys self-contained illusion is broken leaving only sally zoe and scott left with the illusion failing allowing sally to see aidan in pain and josh trying to revive him does she reject scott and goes through her death once more awakening in her ghostly body freeing everyone zoe walks off still angry and josh breaks the salt ring before running off to the woods to change aidan recovered but seeping blood from every orifice welcomes sally home before he goes upstairs to rest zoe comes back with dressing on her wound to tell sally she will never forgive her for what she did to nick sally is left alone except for scott who reminds her that he is a part of her and will always be there waiting for her to slip again 
suren feels confident that she has fulfilled mothers demand of her to put boston back into order and aidan knows that he will no longer be forced to be involved with the vampire community and the two will be able to freely spend time together elsewhere josh and julia enjoy time with each other with josh asking her if she would not mind coming to his place but julia still feels hurt from the break-up with aidan sally does her best to ignore scott who insists that she acknowledge he still exists as a part of her she later reveals to the boys that scott is still bothering her but she thinks that if she makes amends for what she has done she may be able to get rid of him aidan mentions that janet who sally had possessed months ago has been admitted to suffolk county hospitals psychiatric ward the next day she goes to see janet and believes that if josh acts as a go between she can help janet but josh refuses to help elsewhere josh asks aidan if he could bring suren over to serve as a double date so julia could feel more comfortable coming over and he acquiesces aidan convinces suren to follow through as if she is to become a part of his life she has to accept his mundane life the dinner goes through several awkward silences until suren and josh bond over liking antiques roadshow things take a turn when suren realizes julia and aidan dated without aidan having told her but nothing happens between the girls that night aidan comforts suren in the fact that she has a place in his life josh and julia arrive at hospital for work the next day only to find nora has come back julia leaves the two alone and nora reveals that brynn was not the person she thought and she wants to make amends with josh but he has fallen back in love with julia sally finds nora in the hospital who cannot get her job back and after revealing the events of the past couple of weeks sally convinces nora to help her get through to janet elsewhere in the hospital julia presses josh to make the right choice between her and nora with the reaper egging her on to stop helping sally through nora manages to convince janet she is not crazy and that she is sorry for what she has done feeling stronger in herself scott disappears just as josh sees that sally had nora help her cementing the decision in his mind to stay with julia at the halloway hotel mother states her pleasure in how suren and aidan have put boston back in order she still feels suren is not ready to leave forcing her to keep her place in boston however mother does not go back on her deal with aidan but instead of freedom she excommunicates aidan from vampire society with threat of death to anyone who disobeys after asking henry to send a message aidan and suren meet and decide to leave boston after saying a tearful goodbye to josh and sally aidan leaves the house to go on the run with suren later nora goes to see josh one more time still wanting to make amends by revealing she has found the way to lift the werewolf curse josh has to kill ray the werewolf who turned him but not during a full moon aidan and suren make it to a seedy hotel but when suren says she is hungry aidan leaves the room to find a suitable victim to only find henry has given up their location and has brought reinforcements to kill aidan 
aidan prepares to face off against henry and the two vampires he brought with him when henry helps aidan in killing the other vampires having only saved face by pretending to hunt down aidan and suren henry wants to help aidan go on the run but knows that surens presence will prevent that while aidan thanks henry he also partially stakes him so he can tell mother a good story while he remains with suren back in boston josh goes to seek out ray with noras knowledge that killing him will cure the both of them but he sees that ray has reunited with his family ray finds josh and advises him that he should tell his loved ones the truth something that josh struggles with when he returns to boston to find that his and julias old mutual friend from ithaca chelsea has come to town to see the both of them while he deals with reuniting with an old friend sally seeks out zoe at the hospital to ask for forgiveness but cannot find her in the nursery sally manages to find her when zoe reveals that being in the nursery only gives her bad memories and she does not want to help ghosts anymore at a restaurant josh has met up with julia and chelsea to reveal they are a couple once more when julia gets up from the table chelsea sternly asks josh to tell julia the truth about matters before leaving when julia returns sally follows zoe trying to get her to change her mind about ghosts when they realize that there is a solar eclipse happening walter one of the ghosts sally shredded suddenly appears in the park and when sally tells zoe this is where she shredded him she remembers that solar eclipses somehow weaken the barrier between the living and spiritual worlds sally realizes that means nick must have rematerialized as well and they both head to the brownstone julia and josh enjoy each others company and just as josh is ready to tell julia that he is a werewolf the solar eclipse begins to affect him as well beginning a partial transformation he runs out of the restaurant julia following him until he is met with a dead end in an alleyway he turns to face julia partially transformed startling her as she backs up into the street and is hit by a car josh rushes to her aid but still transforming runs away from the growing crowd sally makes it to the house to talk to nick who reveals that they are in some sort of terrifying purgatory that they call limbo where they can only feel pain but not existence when zoe arrives sally stays with danny who is actually happy to see her knowing that he somewhat deserves his fate in limbo while nick lies to zoe that he is now in a better place the eclipse ends and the two return back to purgatory zoe thanks sally for letting her see nick one last time while sally feels guilty that she has put so many in such a terrifying place aidan however has driven many miles to lancaster county pennsylvania to the hiding place of the dutch to seek help from atlee who has since been made the leader of the dutch because of the werewolf aidan gave him aidan blackmails him into giving himself and suren a place to hide and returns to the motel only to find that suren has left suren feeling the blood withdrawal symptoms and not enjoying her situation has returned to boston on her own to reclaim her place as its leader that night josh returns to the accident scene to reveal the truth to julia but she reveals that she has already died and josh is speaking to her ghost she tells him he should have been truthful from the start but she has always loved him before her door appears and she uses it to pass through to the other side 
josh resolves to kill ray to save both himself and nora from the werewolf curse while aidan resolves to kill mother so he and suren may be together at last josh enlists sally to possess rays wife using her to call ray out to a deserted stretch of road under the guise of fixing a flat tire however this act brings the reaper entity back into sallys mind once ray arrives josh marches ray out into the woods at gunpoint meanwhile aidan infiltrates mothers coven and attempts to kill her and finds that henry who helped aidan get inside has been severely beaten and may be dead aidan is eventually captured and brought before mother who kills suren in front of him as she turns to ashes aidan screams in fury and attempts to kill mother but is overpowered aidan is then locked in a coffin and buried alive elsewhere sally returns to the hospital to seek out her mother so she may shred her in order for sally to be able to enter limbo to save all of the ghosts she shredded herself as taking another ghosts door would condemn them to insanity rena refuses to kill her own daughter and after she disappears sally comes across nora and she tells her joshs plans sally returns back to their shared house the reaper still taunting her as rena approaches her to tell sally how proud she is of her now that shes become so strong in death the reconciliation brings renas door forth and she offers it to sally believing that if she can find a way back from the door another will come for her sally thanks her mother for the offer but takes her fate into her own hands by shredding herself all while the reaper protests until he too is destroyed with sallys spirit back in the woods josh hesitates shooting ray who then attacks josh and knocks the gun from his hand before ray can kill josh nora arrives armed with her own weapon she and ray have a stand-off and everything fades to black as a gunshot is heard with aidan buried alive and joshs fate unknown the empty brownhouse is quiet until a radio starts to tune itself into a particular station sallys voice plays over the radio revealing she has found a way out of limbo but she needs the boys help to succeed

ichigo continues his training with kugo ginjō while orihime heals him yet when kugo blinds him and starts to say antagonastic things to make ichigo angry ichigo begins to doubt kugos true intentions when ginjō claims he will kill chad and orihime ichigo is able to see notice his spiritual energy ichigo then manages to wound ginjō with his fullbring reaching its final level and ginjō apologizes for his acting  
after ichigo achieves the final level of fullbring he spends his time perfecting it with xcution deciding to protect ichigo so that they can complete their goal riruka goes to search chad and orihime who are investigating tsukishima riruka ends being ambushed by tsukishima who attacks her with his fullbring tsukishima then confronts chad and orihime who are unable to kill him as a result of tsukishimas fullbring causing him to be part of their memories  
after ichigo puts the finishing touches on completing his fullbring ginjō tells him to go home to see his sisters but tsukishima activates the fullbring he placed on ichigos friends and family in order to make them believe that tsukishima is a close relative of the kurosaki family after running out ichigo encounters ginjō who tells ichigo that all the other members of xcution have fallen under tsukishimas control  
while contemplating what to do next concerning tsukishimas fullbring ginjō and ichigo are found out by yukio and brought to tsukishima once there they are led up to the room where all of the people that were affected by tsukishimas fullbring are waiting for them unable to fight with all of them in the crosshairs ichigo runs away to a safer location but is stopped by the brainwashed xcution however kugo destroys the staircase and takes on the others himself while ichigo fights tsukishima he is able to gain the upper hand with his fullbring and severely injures tsukishimas arm however orihime and chad who are also affected by tsukishima arrive and stop him from finishing tsukishima off surprised by their sudden arrival tsukishima comes from behind and hits ichigo through the wall  
ichigo continues his battle with tsukishima but is unable to hurt him without fighting against orihime and chad who believe he has gone crazy meanwhile ginjō continues his battle with xcution but runs into trouble with moe shishigawara unable to fight back ichigo is overwhlemed by tsukishima and is about to be hit by his fullbring when ginjō takes the hit instead ichigo believes its all over but ginjō is unaffected they are about to continue the fight when uryu arrives ichigo wonders if he is affected by tsukishimas fullbring but uryu claims he is not and says that it was ginjō who attacked him before he can react ichigo is struck down by kugo who starts to laugh maniacally ichigo realizes that ginjō was affected after all but kugo says he is half right he was hit by tsukishima for a second time to return to his original self and stabs ichigo with his sword and says he will take his fullbring  
ginjō is able to take ichigos fullbring and apply its power to his own unable to do anything about his situation ichigo falls deep into despair and runs after ginjō demanding for ginjō to give him his power back ichigo is then impaled by a sword held by rukia which causes him to become a soul reaper once again the sword is revealed to possess the powers from the soul societys gotei 13 army in order to assist ichigo in his fight against ginjō ichigo attacks ginjō with a getsuga tensho which is powerful enough to clear away a thunderstorm and slice tsukishimas mansion in half  
ichigo continues to fight ginjō using his regained soul reaper powers overpowering ginjō ichigo then learns that he regained his powers thanks to all the captains and lieutenants giving him a piece of their own powers then ginjō reappears and tōshirō hitsugaya reveals that ginjō was the first substitute soul reaper meanwhile orihime and chad rush to ichigo and are confused as to why he and the other soul reapers are fighting ginjō tsukishima appears behind them and tries to break their minds by adding new memories to their past urahara and isshin knock them out the other members of xcution are given new powers of their own ichigo attempts to take them down but yukio uses his new powers to protect them and separate the others kenpachi zaraki quickly takes care of giriko and cuts him in half killing him instantly  
uryu comes to assist ichigo in his battle against ginjō byakuya kuchiki prepares to start fighting tsukishima while riruka ambushes rukia using stuffed animals renji abarai encounters jackie and defeats her without the use of his zanpakutō having trained to fight an opponent at aizens level as yukio then attempts to destroy the dimension where renji and jackie are situated he is confronted by hitsugaya hitsugaya manages to capture yukio in ice and attempts to force him to free his comrades meanwhile ikkaku madarame confronts shishigawara managing to find his fullbrings weakness and overpower him  
byakuya starts his battle with tsukishima when tsukishima reveals that he can use his fullbring on inanimate objects as well he traps byakuya and hits him and senbonzakura thus learning all he needs to know about byakuyas weaknesses meanwhile rukia fights against riruka and gets her body trapped in a stuffed animal due to rirukas new powers she attempts to fight with kido but it accidentally implodes inside herself riruka starts to reveal her past and xcutions past which gets her distracted enough for rukia to touch her zanpakuto unable to dodge rukia riruka is forced to use a special ability of her fullbring that causes her to vanish while rukia collapses meanwhile tsukishima is able to overwhelm byakuya and manages to inflict a serious injury however byakuya shoots out his bankai from his hand and it pierces tsukishimas chest byakuya thanks him for an exciting battle and tsukishima falls to the ground  
ichigo and uryu continue their battle with ginjō however when ginjō senses that tsukishima is near death he tells ichigo they have no longer have a reason to fight while revealing that the substitute soul reapers have been constantly spyed on by the soul society to monitor their actions however using his bankai to destroy the dimension with rukia and the soul reaper captains looking on ichigo admits knowing about the revelation yet still intends to trust soul society for aiding him in protecting the people close to him this has ginjō releases his own bankai in response to ichigos resolve as the two have a final clash  
the battle between ichigo and ginjō comes to a close when the latter receives a mortal wound just as ginjō is about to die the dying tsukishima tries to kill ichigo but is stopped by riruka as she emerges from rukias body shishigawa proceeds to carry tsukishima away while the other surviving xcution members decide to separate ichigo later returns to soul society and requests that head captain yamamoto let ginjōs body be buried within the human world as the last thing he can do for him yamamoto agrees just as ichigo accepts to continue being a substitute soul reaper rukia sees ichigo off recalling their time together and silently thanks him ichigo smiles and tells rukia see ya later before returning to karakura town where he is greeted by his friends and family notably before the episode ends ichigo breaks the fourth wall as he says see you again perhaps hinting the anime adaption will return in the future

kiera tries to find the members of liber8 before they do more damage the liber8 freedom fighters are trying to return back to their own time kiera knows this and has every intention of using this opportunity to travel along with them so she can reunite with her family their first attempt fails but when liber8 kidnap an university physicist kiera knows exactly where to find them meanwhile kieras pretense of being a portland police officer doesnt last very long - her cover is blown and she soon finds herself under arrest by her partner on the vpd carlos when kiera discovers liber8s plan to make a second attempt she manages to get free and has to escape and then approach her sworn enemies alone ultimately the attempt fails and a despondent kiera is forced to accept she may be stuck in 2012 although with alecs help she creates a profile for herself that convinces the police that she is a government agent so deep undercover that they cant possibly figure out who she really works for one member of the terrorist group matthew kellog has decided to stay and not return to his own time 
kiera and carlos investigate a series of mysterious murders where two victims have had large cylindrical holes incised into the backs of their necks and were drained of endocrine fluid - in fact the victims pituitary glands have been removed a review of the victims dna reveal a special gene one that would be used in a futuristic super-soldier and so they discover that the crimes were committed by liber8 unknown to kiera liber8 is making the effort to save travis their leader in the absence of edouard kagame who is believed to have not survived the jump who is quite ill and the glands are needed to synthesize a cure hes on his death bed however leading some in the group to start jockeying for position in the hopes of replacing him kellog one of the group who is going rogue from liber8 arranges to meet kiera and tries asking for a cease-fire with kiera by bringing her a gift one that could cost her and carlos their lives but it may just be a trap ultimately both survive and it leads to kellogs expulsion from liber8 
kiera and carlos investigate the murder of a professor martin ames a scientist that was working to develop a source of clean energy which will be fruitful to all humanity who was found slain while experimenting with a high energy device its apparent that the weapon used to kill him is quite advanced and kiera believes that it could be the work of liber8 his graduate student shane mathers offers to help them but finds that all of the professors files were stolen they suspect dr melissa dobeck a former partner who split with ames after a disagreement over ownership of the intellectual property but she denies having anything to do with it they hit a brick wall when the military takes over their case on national security grounds meanwhile liber8s leader kagame suddenly arrives in the present hes taken to the hospital but quickly sets out to find others in his group no one knows why he didnt arrive at the same time as the others and for that matter if anyone else from the future may also be here kellog has made a fortune in the stock market - a little advance knowledge can go a long way - and is enjoying his new-found wealth he extends a helping hand to maddie paying off the mortgage on her house she thinks he may be coming on to her but he assures her thats not the case - in fact maddie is his grandmother though he doesnt tell her that the list of possible suspects in amess demise leads kiera to a precarious place in her personal journey where she must decide between doing the right thing to do and the preservation of the future she so desperately wants to go home to 
kagame’s return begins with a reset of liber8’s agenda away from violence and towards blending into the community and fostering their revolution through co-opting existing structures but they have a vulnerability - the possibility that if their ancestors living in this time are murdered they might cease to exist due to kieras interference liber8 have decided to deal with her and kagame has a plan by killing her grandmother lily jones kiera will never be born - getting rid of kiera once and for all as eliminating her grandmother means kiera will never exist and also testing the theory with kiera and her grandmother as the guinea pigs the first woman they kill by the name of lily turns out to be the wrong woman and when kiera hears the news she knows exactly what kagames up to she sets out to find her grandmother but isnt quite ready for the pregnant and homeless punk she finds living on the street kellog gives her a heads up but a suspicious kagame has already taken out insurance against him - kellogs grandmother maddie the game they are playing soon becomes tit for tat with no possible winner

byro overpowers natsu with his ability to nullify all forms of magic though natsu and his friends determination moves coco into betraying legion before byro can defeat natsu the rest of the guild members arrive with the remaining clock parts guided to the crypt when the parts react to each other however gathering all six parts in one place causes the infinity clock to assemble itself with a reformed oración seis appearing alongside it  
led by midnight now calling himself brain ii the members of the reborn oración seis use their new powers to defeat both fairy tail and legion fairy tail is rescued by blue pegasus while the oración seis disappear with the infinity clock lucy rereads key of the starry heavens and realizes that her father entrusted her with the clock hand to prevent the clock from being constructed realizing that they were not supposed to collect the clock parts fairy tail sets out to stop both the oración seis and the infinity clock  
fairy tail learns that the oración seis are destroying churches as part of their plan to complete the infinity clocks power using canas divination the members of fairy tail split into new groups and head out to undestroyed churches where they find members of legion and the oración seis waiting for them meanwhile gildarts and laki investigate the long-abandoned plantation of michelles family legion adds the convict guttman to their ranks and lahar interrogates the zentopia cardinal lapointe about oración seiss recent escape from prison  
lahar enlists the help of doranbalt who has retired out of depression over his inability to help fairy tail on sirius island meanwhile natsu and wendys teams face off against oración seis jackpot and grim reaper formerly erigor of eisenwald respectively and gajeel and juvia find guttman and mary hughes attacking a church while gildarts and laki investigate a church filled with artificial priests and nuns

the members of the oración seis stop fighting fairy tail and resume their mission of casting anti-links on the celestial wizards hidden in churches completely lifting the seal on the infinity clocks true form a massive clockwork dreadnought byro meanwhile tells natsus team of his orders from lapointe to bring lucy to zentopias archbishop with oración seiss plan complete michelle reveals her true identity as a member of oración seis imitatia who posed as lucys relative to manipulate fairy tail into helping them she also reveals her authority as archbishop given to her by the real one forcing byro to follow her orders and kidnaps lucy  
natsu is imprisoned in zentopia cathedral along with the butt jiggle gang but later manages to break free and brings coco along as well meanwhile lucy is pinned into a device while the oracion seis prepare to activate real nightmare the magic that the infinity clock contains the group of archaeologists that lucy previously encountered whose leader revealed to be the descendant of will neville and an acquaintance of jude heartfilia show up at the guild and ask fairy tail to stop the clock later ichiya comes with the redesigned christina to bring erza gray elfman mirajane wendy and warren to zentopia cathedral racer appears in the airship and mirajane decides to battle him  
the infinity clock turns out to be affecting the time state of humans mirajane defeats racer and ichiya fights kanaloa which byro sends out just as the airship arrives at the zentopia cathedral natsu and coco encounters guttman but mary hughes comes to aid them and decides to take him on by herself gildarts and laki gets to the archbishops room first and finds out that the archbishop is being controlled by cardinal lapointe byro overhears this and rushes to face lapointe off  
the reason why lucy is kidnapped is that since the infinity clock needs celestial wizards to seal it the one that can control it should be a celestial wizard as well led by coco natsu gray erza gajeel and elfman set off to the infinity castle to defeat the oracion seis in order to change the ownership of the clock so they can stop it and save lucy however cobra angel and midnight interfere causing erza gray and gajeel take on each of them respectively lapointe is actually a doll created by personification magic using master zeros hair gildarts somehow manage to defeat byro  
as lucy is slowly being sucked within the infinity clock imitatia faces off against natsu elfman and coco in addition every other member of fairy tail starts working to stop the infinity clock from bringing forth chaos and to find the runaway kinana erza and cobra continue their match gray and dan straight face off against angel whose self-titled magic proves to be more dangerous for her than it is for her opponents  
while erza concludes her battle with cobra lucy is slowly becoming part of the infinity clock the process has already begun and hope is lost until the archbishop who regains consciousness comes up with a way to slow down the process destroying the chains linking to earth land legion and fairy tail cooperate in order to stop brain ii and destroy the clocks chains meanwhile brain ii tells imitatia that should lucy be fully merged with the clock all memory of lucy will vanish horrified imitatia rushes to save lucy only to be reverted by brain ii into her true form a doll lucy owned as a child  
natsu finally manages to defeat midnight when the wizard overestimates his ability to control the entirety of the infinity clock by himself as the dark guilds possession of the clock is revoked lucy floats inside the golden liquid of the clock remembering her childhood and connection to her doll michell as she hears her friends calling her lucy tries to escape the clock and is able to do so with the help of jean-luc and the others at the fairy tail guild sending out blue shooting stars to find and return those affected by anti-link to their normal selves lucy is separated from the clock and falls from the sky being caught by natsu and reuniting with her guild at last her adventure surrounding her fathers memento at an end  


the legion platoon is tasked by zentopias archbishop to retrieve the missing pieces of the infinity clock and seal them again before embarking on their mission they visit fairy tail and make amends with the guild for their previous hostility against them it is later discovered that fairy tail has lost their title as the strongest guild in fiore to the saber tooth guild over the past seven years two of the strongest wizards in the guild include a pair of dragon slayers named sting and rogue who are obsessed with fighting natsu and gajeel respectively meanwhile makarov brings gildarts to their abandoned guildhall and shows him lumen histoire a light that makarov says is fairy tails greatest secret makarov then tells gildarts that he has been chosen to become the next master of fairy tail  
natsu and his friends discover that a power gap has developed between them and the rest of the guild members who were not on sirius island the group meets with poluchka for medicine to strengthen their magic but are unsuccessful wendy recognizes poluchkas voice and scent as those of grandine the dragon who raised her poluchka reveals herself as the edolas counterpart of grandine and gives wendy written instructions for two advanced spells that grandine failed to teach her meanwhile makarov announces gildarts succession as master to the rest of the guild only to find he has gone on a journey leaving a letter of resignation behind in the letter gildarts reinstates laxus into the guild returns mastership to makarov and tells him to make fairy tail the strongest guild in fiore again romeo suggests they participate in the grand magic games an annual festival designed to determine the guild rankings in fiore  
with the grand magic games occurring in three months time natsu and his friends train at a beach resort on their second day of training virgo appears and tells the wizards that the celestial spirit world is in danger of destruction when the wizards arrive they instead find a surprise party held by the celestial spirit king celebrating their return from sirius island after seven years they spend the day in the spirit world partying with the spirits before they leave however virgo informs them that one day in the spirit world equals three months in the human world and they find the grand magic games are upon them  
while mulling over their lost training time the fairy tail wizards receive a message via carrier pigeon requesting a private meeting in the forest nearby there they meet a runaway jellal ultear and merudy who have formed their own guild crime sorcière to defeat zeref and any dark guilds that try to use his power the three ask fairy tail for their help in determining the source of a magical anomaly similar to zerefs magic that they have sensed around the grand magic games arena domus flau in exchange ultear uses her magic to invoke their second origin in order to double their magic power as the others undergo the painful process of awakening their second origin erza talks with jellal over his regained memories the two nearly kiss but jellal decides that he and erza cannot be together and lies to her that he has a fiancée erza quickly picks up on this and respects his decision seeing crime sorcière off as they leave  
natsu lucy gray erza and wendy are chosen to represent their guild in the grand magic games which are to be held in fiores capital crocus as they tour the city natsu and happy encounter the twin dragon slayers sting and rogue who mock natsu for not being able to kill acnologia and boast of becoming true dragon slayers by killing the dragons who raised them at midnight fairy tail and the other participating guilds are put through a preliminary event—a race through a massive floating labyrinth—designed to narrow the number of participating guilds down to eight teams  
natsus team notices that wendy has gone missing so elfman replaces her to keep them from being eliminated as they make their way through the enchanted labyrinth the five encounter various other guilds and steal the maps made by the other guilds to better navigate the maze they manage to reach the end of the maze and pass the elimination round confident they have arrived first only to discover they have barely taken last place meanwhile happy lisanna and the rest of the guild search for wendy and carla they eventually find the two in the garden of the kings palace mercurius with their magic power depleted  
wendys body is weakened as a result of losing her magic power as poluchka helps her recover she formally requests elfman to take her place in the grand magic games fairy tail steps into the arena with a negative audience reception but they are bolstered by their guild mates and the spirit of mavis whom only the fairy tail guild members can see the next four participating teams are revealed to be quatro cerberus mermaid heel blue pegasus and lamia scale following them is raven tail a former dark guild led by makarovs son ivan who confess to attacking wendy and carla to everyones shock the next team is revealed to be a second team from fairy tail composed of gajeel juvia mirajane laxus and jellal disguised as mystogan to help investigate the arena the final guild to be announced is saber tooth much to the joy of the audience with all eight teams announced they each send out one member to participate in the first contest of the games with gray and juvia representing their teams

after laxus defeats ivan and the four raven tail elite members ivans illusions disappear to the shock of everyone in the stadium the game officials declare laxus the victor and ivan tells him that lumen histoire is fairy tail’s darkness due to the infraction of the rules the raven tail team is disqualified for the remainder of the games and its members are captured by the soldiers later wendy of fairy tail team a and sherria blendy of team lamia scale face off to compete for the final match of the day as the two exchange attacks gusts of wind surround the arena since sherria is revealed to be a sky god slayer wendy employs an advanced sky dragon slayer attack much to poluchkas astonishment causing sherria to fall on the ground wendy is about to be announced as the winner of the bout when sherria suddenly stands up with her wounds fully healed meanwhile the crime sorcière guild senses the nefarious aura and jellal proceeds to the domus flau audience oblivious that he bumped into doranbalt who in turn wonders what is mystogan doing in earthland  
with cheria being fully healed and wendy being almost depleted of magic power their battle continues with the former casting a high-level spell towards the latter however it seems that wendy enhances cherias physical strength causing the attack to gain much force and thus missing wendy the two competitors then engage in a hand-to-hand combat but due to the time limit and neither side is giving up their battle resulted in a draw giving both teams with 5 points meanwhile jellal manages to track the sinister aura among the crowd in the form of a mysterious hooded person jellal is about to confront the aura source but he is abruptly cornered by doranbalt lahar and other rune knights doranbalt then interrogates jellal and as his cover was blown the rune knights as well as kagura and milliana glancing nearby are startled to see the true identity of mystogan yajima convinces the rune knights that mystogan is jellal’s edolas counterpart prompting lahar to release the fugitive meanwhile laxus and makarov have a small conversation regarding lumen histoire when mavis appears and explains that lumen histoire is the ‘light’ of fairy tail

while lucy is hospitalized and taken to the infirmary the fairy tail members warn saber tooth that they have angered the worst possible guild to do so later makarov announces that the two fairy tail teams must merge as a result of the disqualification of raven tail and to compensate for the odd number of teams for the battle round he also reveals that the new team will have the former team as 35 points to start with the new fairy tail team consisting of natsu gray erza gajeel and laxus are well-received as they enter the field the second part of the tournament begins with a tag battle between blue pegasus ichiya and rabbit and quatro puppys rocker and bacchus to everyones shock it is revealed that rabbit is actually nichiya in disguise and after the exceed is punched by bacchus ichiya bulks up to defeat the quatro puppy opponents awarding blue pegasus with 10 points

the tag battle continues with sting and rogue beginning to attack natsu and gajeel with their powers being increased after receiving heavy blows from the saber tooth dragon slayers natsu and gajeel manages to hold them off thus forcing sting and rogue to activate “dragon force” on their own will to the shock of the fairy tail audience sting decides to finish the fairy tail dragon slayers alone for he held a promise to his exceed friend lector many years ago as the three mages fight the tide turns in favor of sting as he unleashes a powerful attack on natsu and gajeel resulting in the collapse of the arena floor and after a hand-to-hand combat underground sting was seemingly the victor of the match however the fairy tail duo stands up comments on sting’s strength and argues about his position while attacking thereby causing natsu to drag gajeel on a mining cart and send it away while gajeel is left incapacitated due to motion sickness natsu challenges the twin dragons of saber tooth alone in retribution to what sting did earlier on them

after devils demise quarles extends an offer of partnership to boyd crowder however boyd refuses quarles offer calling him a carpetbagger someone from the north who uses southern workers for profit which quarles seems to take offense to limehouse reveals to his associates that he was lying to dickie about the status of the bennett fortune and that he has a woman on his payroll who has a connection to one of quarles underlings meanwhile dewey crowe is in a race against time to collect for a sadistic organ harvester or else succumb to kidney failure after dewey robs a series of odd locations with varying success raylan tracks him down to a convenience store where he helps the frightened crowe realize that he still has his kidneys raylan goes to the organ traffickers house to investigate and manages to turn the tables on the traffickers leaving both of them dead raylan returns home to find his house empty and reads a letter presumably left by winona 
raylan goes looking for winona and starts to get nervous when he sees the marked secret service money from the evidence locker has disappeared again he finds winona at her sisters and she denies taking the money but explains to raylan that she left because she is resigned to it never working with him raylan and art eventually figure out that the elderly evidence clerk took the money when one of the bills pops up in el paso texas quarles associates led by tanner brendan mccarthy hit boyds underground oxy clinic set up at aunt helens house leaving three dead raylan is led to boyd by arlo who seems disoriented and is talking to himself he tracks down the survivor of the hit with the help of boyd and ava who suspect limehouse might have something to do with the hit raylan convinces the survivor to help him after laying into her pimp and he tracks down the mobile oxy clinic set up by tanner raylan gets into a scuffle with tanner in the clinic as its being driven through a field throwing tanner from the truck and shooting the driver who bleeds to death raylan looks for tanner who escapes on foot wynn duffy tells quarles of the situation thinking he was behind it quarles has no idea what hes talking about but he is ecstatic at the prospects of a war meanwhile limehouse hears of what happened and confronts his assistant who reveals he gave up boyds oxy clinic to get hit by tanner he accepts his mistake and offers his life to limehouse who refuses to let him off that easy and tells his henchman that he will be right on the front line to watch what he started 
a wounded tanner shows up at limehouses holler begging for forgiveness for letting raylan get involved limehouse forgives him and lets tanner lick his wounds only if he agrees to provide information on quarles movements they are interrupted by a disoriented arlo who is off his medication and thinks his late wife raylans mother is hiding with limehouse again an annoyed limehouse knocks arlo out and delivers the old man to boyd as raylan tries to adjust to life without winona quarles gets on his bad side when he approaches raylan assuming hes on boyd crowders payroll quarles also enlists sheriff napier of harlan to disrupt johnnys bar which causes boyd to reach out to someone hes helped in the past raylan finds out from an exasperated tim that quarles is meeting with the son of detroits biggest racketeer and interrogates him at the horse stables where he finds out that the detroit mob has been experiencing problems with quarles as well and want him gone with this blessing raylan uses a judge to shut down quarles developing underground clinic which causes quarles and duffy to smoke out winonas ex-husband gary william ragsdale 
quarles and duffy bring gary back to harlan and kill him on winonas front lawn putting raylan in the crosshairs of the fbi and the lexington homicide department with the help of tim and winona raylan manages to clear his name and avoid prosecution later he visits the house where quarles was forced to vacate to find duffy painting a room where quarles presumably killed someone raylan warns duffy that quarles is going down and he is going to take wynn down with him if they stay together elsewhere quarles is approached by limehouse who wants to make money from both sides of the quarles/boyd feud quarles rebuffs limehouses offer and sets up boyd by blowing up the current sheriff of harlans car putting him in jail and delaying boyds campaigning for a new harlan sheriff tanner returns to quarles and is threatened at first but sent on a job that requires him to shoot somebody in a crowded room when quarles finds out from the detroit bosss son that raylan has been cleared of suspicion he loses his composure and threatens to shoot him the bosss son baits quarles to shoot him telling him it will lead to a short lonely existence feeling cornered for the first time quarles shows up alone at nobles holler and sheepishly asks limehouse for assistance 
after dodging a close call with garys death raylan puts his focus back on quarles who is having logistical problems with sheriff napiers campaign after raylan is visited by ava he sees boyd in jail who tells raylan that he is being framed by tanner he explains tanners involvement with quarles and the blowing up of sheriff napiers car which leads raylan to deduce that tanner was the one who got away from the mobile oxy clinic raylan clears boyds name for the bombing which lets boyd show up to a town hall debate between quarles candidate sheriff napier and boyds candidate shelby jim beaver with the help of his charisma boyd wins over the crowd in favor of shelby raylan looks for tanner who is told by limehouses man errol to get a refund for the bomb he put in napiers car the two of them rob the old bomb maker but tanner steps on a landmine he gives errol the money to give to his mother before it arms itself raylan later arrives on the scene to try to get information out of him but the mine explodes under tanner before he could get anything however raylan watches tanners mothers house and sees errol delivering the money to her he visits limehouse that night and warns him that hes getting closer to burying quarles but limehouse doesnt seem worried and instead menacingly reminds raylan of when he nearly killed his dad right in front of him when raylan was little elsewhere ava goes against johnny crowders wishes when she kills an abusive pimp who was paying boyd crowder protection money but tells a curious boyd that she is considering taking on his position 
with the sheriff election soon at hand boyd and quarles both make maneuvers in their camps to get their candidate to win limehouse hedges his bets and eventually decides to help boyd crowder by introducing him to quarles campaign manager crowder gets napiers sister a job with the county this technicality costs sheriff napier the election even though he had won the majority of voters this reversal sends quarles into a drug fueled tailspin and he reveals to duffy his childhood of being trafficked by his father quarles decides to directly confront raylan telling him that he is going to put a bullet in his head raylan is dealing with another problem as dickie is set to be granted early release due to lack of evidence on his charges of kidnapping raylan and murdering aunt helen raylan chases down all the people involved with dickies crimes but they refuse to testify raylan goes to testify in favor of dickie remaining in prison but he bungles it and eventually tells judge reardon to just release dickie because hell either slip up again or be killed in the process at nobles holler limehouse hears from errol that dickie is getting out which might cause problems for the missing bennett fortune so he tells errol to bring dickie to him as soon as he is released at the close of the episode quarles is alone in a hotel room sniffing oxycontin repeating a mantra to himself as quarles strips it is revealed that he has kidnapped another young man holding him in his bathroom 
quarles tries to maintain control in his war with boyd crowder by killing a drug dealer on the crowder payroll taking his supplies but his problems extend beyond harlan as the boss in detroit theo tonin adam arkin is sending hired guns michael ironside and chris tardio to deal with the quarles problem after being embarrassed by raylan they find wynn duffy and put him in contact with theo wynn takes them to quarles motel room but they are being followed by raylan and art who were watching wynns trailer after raylan rescues quarles hostage and arrests the detroit hitmen quarles notices the commotion and flees to nobles holler to lay low limehouse tells quarles he could hide out as long as he has the money which quarles doesnt unbeknownst to quarles boyd has intimidated sheriff napier into turning on him so when napier calls up quarles and tells him he knows a place where he could dump the drugs quarles walks into a trap set up by boyd who uses a taser to render him unconscious telling a couple prostitutes to strip him and tie him to the bed meanwhile dickie is released from prison and tries to worm his way back into the bennett fortune with the help of old associates things hit a snag when his associates are approached by tim and rachel who use them to get information on the remainder of dickies money dickies forty thousand dollars independent from the real fortune is seized by tim and rachel when erroll presents it to him but dickie convinces erroll to help him go against limehouse to find the real fortune erroll eventually accepts dickies proposal only adding that they are going to need someone with a particular skill-set to get the bennett fortune that someone being boyd crowder 
quarles gets boyds prostitutes high on oxy and subsequently manages to escape from audreys duffy is furious because he wants to collect theo tonins reward for quarles duffy conspires with boyd to blow up quarles in his car errol and dickie visit boyds bar to approach boyd about robbing the bank where limehouse put mags money things go sideways quickly with boyd attacking dickie trying to asphyxiate him with a plastic bag while beating him severely ava intervenes and asks that boyd hear dickie out angering arlo who also wants dickie dead for murdering helen in season 2 boyd sends ava and arlo to case the bank which gets the attention of the state police and trooper tom bergen who calls raylan raylan then goes to audreys to look for quarles but finds the two prostitutes and boyds man jimmy tied up boyd figures out that errol is trying to set him up as limehouse would not keep the money in a bank that has been robbed multiple times raylan soon figures out the same thing and confronts limehouse who then tells him that the money is with loretta mccready the girl who had been taken in by mags after the murder of her father after casing the bank ava and arlo go to her house arlo off his meds locks ava in her own basement and leaves to find and kill dickie back at the bar dickie gets the drop on johnny and then forces the location of the money out of errol dicki goes to lexington to rob loretta upon entering lorettas house dickie finds raylan waiting after a brief exchange dickie pulls his gun and raylan shoots him after he realizes that the bank job was a setup quarles goes to boyds bar to confront him while duffy watches from a distance when boyd approaches quarles duffy and mike blow up quarles car drawing trooper tom to the scene he orders quarles to drop his weapon and we hear a shot when raylan arrives moments later he finds tom fatally wounded quarles gone boyd unconscious and johnny yelling that quarles shot tom

in the forest at that moment django continues searching for the usopp pirates and they toss him a white flag django walks forward and so the usopp pirates launch their ambush django trips over a rope and one of the usopp pirates showers him with pepper making him sneeze the second jumps out and strikes django in the groin with a frying pan the third leaps down from a large rock and takes a swing at djangos head but django sits up in time and knocks his attacker away kaya then comes out telling django not to hurt the kids but django reports that it was his orders from kuro to kill the children kaya then grabs djangos chakram and holds it in front of her throat threatening to kill herself without writing the will django agrees and so he gets kaya to write the will once finished he grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree holding up a chakram to kill her zoro is still running through the woods with usopp on his back and usopp spots django as the episode draws to a close  
kuros ultimate attack shakushi attacks everything in the area whether friend or foe and luffy becomes enraged by his lack of regard for his crew luffy manages to catch kuro by binding his limbs and headbutts him with gum gum bell while usopp shoots jango with an exploding star saving kaya usopp convinces kaya and the usopp pirates to keep the incident a secret in order to enable the village to stay peaceful kaya gives the straw hats the going merry as a gift and luffy invites usopp into the crew having befriended him  
 
the episode opens with usopp pretending he is in a great battle as captain of the going merry fending off attacking pirates as he is doing so luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship and holds it up its a terribly drawn skull and crossbones of course the others are horrified of the artwork and so usopp tells them that he is a great painter he paints a pirate flag with his own face on it but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag a very nice one at that they fly it on the mast and continue to sail as they are sailing nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope saying it is legendary treasure island usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island but if one tries to claim it they will face gods wrath 
as the straw hats draw nearer to the island the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy after a tough sail they make it to the island the straw hats head into the jungle looking for treasure zoro lies down and starts to nap and as usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this the straw hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals creatures that are combinations of two or more animals a voice booms through the jungle claiming to be the guardian god of the island and telling them to leave luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face the voice is shocked and luffy explains he ate the devils fruit a gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots luffy in the back but luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his gomu gomu powers luffy then spots a twitching green bush and the owner of the voice takes off running 
luffy usopp and nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest named gaimon luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the grand line and claim one piece but gaimon doesnt think he can do it luffy and gaimon converse about how they cant read a map and nami is angered by this gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as zoro finally joins them he explains that twenty years ago he was with his crew in search of the treasure and as they were leaving he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell getting stuck in a treasure box he found that his crew had left and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself but found he could not climb in the box when luffy tries to pull gaimon out of the box he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box and his body will be ruined if the box is broken luffy then realizes that gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors 
inspired by gaimons story the straw hats decide to help gaimon find the treasure they come to the ridge and luffy uses gomu gomu no rocket to launch himself up to the top where there are five treasure chests he refuses to hand them over to gaimon and while this shocks and angers nami and usopp gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty luffy confirms this and so gaimon begins to cry saying that hes been guarding nothing for twenty years luffy says it could be worse as he could have died guarding nothing and he offers gaimon to join their crew gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island however as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure with this adventure behind them the straw hats set sail in the going merry once again waving goodbye to gaimon as the episode draws to a close  
while usopp &amp luffy fool around with the ships cannon one day zoro dreams about his childhood he had joined a dojo after losing to the teachers daughter kuina despite training and growing stronger he still was unable to defeat her when she told him that he would one day defeat her as she grew weaker zoro grew upset over her defeatist attitude and made her promise that one of them would be the worlds greatest swordsman she died soon afterward and zoro dedicated himself to fulfilling the promise back in the present a bounty hunter attacks the ship but zoro recognizes him  
 
after a review of the ending of the previous episode the episode begins with marine lieutenant iron fist fullbody pouring a drink to a beautiful lady on his marine ship and saying how he is taking her to the greatest restaurant in the world the lady then questions if the restaurant is in the middle of the ocean which fullbody answers by telling her to just look forward to it 
in the meantime on the going merry zoro recognizes the intruder who got beat up by luffy from the last episode as johnny johnny then brings the straw hat pirates attention to yosaku who lies ill on his and johnnys small ship turns out that johnny yosaku and zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took yosaku to a small rock island to rest which was coincidentally blown up by usopp and luffy for target practice in the last episode usopp and luffy quickly apologize johnny however was more worried about yosakus condition which nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin c luffy and usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into yosakus mouth and yosaku is revived or at least for 5 minutes the straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as baratie he also states that the one zoro has been looking for hawk-eyes mihawk is near there too 
thus they head to baratie which actually is pretty much right next to where they were they then get passed by fullbodys marine ship fullbody doesnt recognize the straw hat pirates mark but he recognizes johnny and yosaku as worthless pirate hunters johnny responds by shouting this is what pirate hunters do while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air nami takes note of the arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chiefs room in baratie where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year 
in baratie while attempting to impress his girlfriend fullbody instead becomes humiliated by sanjis witty remarks turns out that sanji is actually the assistant head chef frustrated fullbody destroys his table full of food sanji who is angry that fullbody wasted precious food beats fullbody up  
 
after a review of the last episode the episode begins with patty a cook for baratie picking his nose in the bathroom while making a monologue about how serving the customers who have money is the number one concern for a restaurant upon leaving the bathroom patty becomes furious when he sees that sanji is beating up fullbody who is a customer sanji replies that customer or not fullbody insulted a chef and his food at this moment the head chef and luffy come crashing down from the ceiling because the head chef was kicking luffy too hard while trying to convince him that he has to work at baratie for a whole year to pay off his debt the head chef then kicks sanji to calm him down and also kicks fullbody out of the restaurant fullbodys subordinate then comes running into the restaurant yelling that their prisoner a member of don kriegs pirates has escaped the customers are terrified because don krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in east blue the pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him the pirate points a gun at patty and says is a bullet okay patty then beats the pirate up and doesnt recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money 
sanji on the other hand heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal fullbody in the meantime leaves the restaurant sneakily along with the subordinate who got shot earlier guess he is still alive sanji brings his meal to the pirate who was thrown out by patty sanji states that for him a customer is anybody who is hungry he also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else the pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life luffy who was watching the whole thing attempts to recruit sanji as the cook for his crew after refusing and some conversing we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame luffy as always is stubborn and insists that sanji joins them we also find out that the other pirates name is gin meanwhile in the kitchen we learn that don krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships gin thanks sanji for the meal and leaves sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that sanji is giving out food for free which makes gin even more grateful 
luffy is then sent back to work where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen the rest of the crew zoro nami and usopp turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant sanji after seeing nami is captivated by her beauty while flirting with nami the head chef tells sanji that hes annoying and that he doesnt need him anymore meanwhile gin informs don krieg of the restaurant where don krieg makes clear his intention to visit the restaurant  
ghin returns to the baratie with his captain don krieg on a nearly destroyed ship and begs the cooks to feed him sanji feeds him again despite knowing that he is evil but krieg betrays him and demands 100 meals for his men as well as the restaurant ship the cooks oppose sanji but zeff agrees to prepare the food  
it is revealed that chef zeff was a great pirate known as red foot zeff who sailed in the grand line but lost his leg at some point ghin explains the catastrophe the fleet met in grand line when they encountered hawk-eyes mihawk who destroyed all but one of their ships krieg feeds his men and is about to begin to attack the baratie when mihawk attacks his ship  
as nami steals the merry go mihawk has returned to finish the job but zoro challenges him to a duel in order to achieve his dream of being the worlds strongest swordsman despite his best efforts he is easily outclassed but gains some respect by persisting despite his inability to win luffy sends zoro usopp johnny and yosaku ahead to follow nami so that he can defeat krieg to pay his debt to the baratie  
mihawk leaves after defeating zoro so krieg continues his invasion he has pearl one of his stronger crewmates attack and sanji reveals his fighting skills gaining the upper hand on pearl but ghin takes zeff hostage  
with zeff held captive by ghin sanji has no choice but to take pearls hits he reveals that he worked on a cruise ship that zeff attacked and when a storm hit the two were the only survivors zeff sacrificed his leg to save sanji and gave sanji food as both shared the same dream of finding the legendary ocean all blue no longer able to fight with his legs and be a pirate zeff founded the baratie sanji reveals that he will defend the baratie with his life and luffy responds by attacking the ships porch with gum gum axe  
ghin finishes off pearl claiming that he wants to kill sanji himself a lengthy battle ensues but ghin eventually gains the upper hand after sanji breaks his ribs ghin however comes to terms with himself realizing he does not have the strength to kill the man who saved him from malnutrition he then begs don krieg to leave the baratie alone but krieg is just disgusted with this show of emotion because of this ghin is no longer a member of the krieg pirates and don krieg decides to have him executed he then pulls off one of his shoulder pads attatches it to his hand and it turns into a launcher for one of his deadliest weapons the mh5 poison gas bomb even ghin and the krieg pirates are shocked at this length of execution and are quick to put on their masks except ghin who throws his in the water the baratie chefs swim away while patty and carne run inside with zeff and luffy attempts to make a beeline for krieg but is thrown back by the needle gun concealed in the launcher shoulder pad krieg fires the mh5 while luffy steals two masks from two krieg pirates and throws them to sanji and ghin he turns round to get another for himself but the pirates have vanished out of nowhere a gas mask lands in luffys lap and he puts it on just as the mh5 impacts and explodes  
it is revealed that the mask luffy was wearing was ghins while he held sanjis to his face krieg succeeds in poisoning ghin and patty and carne pull him inside the baratie to administer first aid outraged luffy runs for krieg who pulls out his needle gun again but they dont even hinder luffy krieg pulls out his spiked porcupine cape and covers himself but luffy punches right into hit striking don krieg in the face luffy seems to have the advantage in the fight until krieg pulls out his explosive battle spear

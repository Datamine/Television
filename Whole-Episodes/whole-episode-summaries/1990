dallas reels from the news of aprils death heartbroken and alone bobby wanders the streets of paris cliff asks liz to marry him but when she learns that johnny was responsible for her brothers death she is given the choice to marry cliff or finally bring johnny to justice aprils death leads james to try to make peace with jr but jr is not willing to listen liz rejects cliffs proposal and ends their relationship bobby buys a detective agency and makes finding sheila foley their sole purpose jr witnesses a public argument between carter and a love-starved rose and seizes the opportunity to gain some control over weststar by giving rose what she wants cliff is warned to never see liz again bobby blames the oil business for aprils death 
michelle returns to dallas furious that bobby had april buried in paris clayton also returns to dallas without miss ellie to settle matters concerning the weststar shares not wanting to inadvertently hurt bobby sly has a change of heart concerning her plan with james to get back at jr however james is as determined as ever to go ahead with the plan and takes slys records of jrs misdeeds over the years after bobby tells clayton to stay out of the oil business and just enjoy the rest of his life clayton offers the voting rights to the weststar stock to carter so long as weststar doesnt go after ewing oil cliff reacts badly when he sees liz having dinner with johnny jr uses their indiscretion to blackmail rose into bugging carters office at weststar johnny tells carter that he is going to take over weststar when vanessa shows up at ewing oil jr tells her that this time hes not letting her go johnny is found shot dead

leeann reveals to michelle that there is another aspect of her former relationship with jr that she hasnt told michelle but it is too painful to talk about liz tells bobby that that the fake sheila foleys real name is hilary taylor during a conversation with vanessa michelle embellishes her relationship with james blames jr for breaking them up and lists numerous other ways jr hurt james carters trial gets underway and later he is eventually found guilty when vanessa expresses misgivings over leeann possible feelings for jr jr dismisses her concern bobby learns that hilary taylor has a daughter cliff makes a confession

jr doesnt tell james about deborah lynn the woman that claims to be his wife and then worries that if james isnt legally married to michelle he will lose his 50% ownership of ewing oil carter wants cliff to resign as energy czar and threatens to expose cliff as johnnys murderer bobby enjoys showing christopher what he knows about cattle ranching while jr starts to bond with his grandson he tries to keep james and deborah lynn apart at least until james can secure his shares of ewing oil bobby tries to be a friend to cliff but cliff pushes him away just as both jr and michelle feel that they are going to have what they want deborah lynn pushes her way into southfork and announces to james that they are still married

goku and gohan arrive at master roshis island to meet bulma krillin master roshi and turtle quickly the others notice the difference between gohans behavior and that of goku as a child goku informs his friends that chi chi refuses to allow gohan to fight instead he studies constantly the same mysterious alien arrives at the island and reveals himself he is a saiyan warrior named raditz and he is gokus older brother he also reveals that gokus real saiyan name is kakarrot goku learns that he was sent to destroy all life on earth but his memory loss from a terrible fall as a child prevented this outcome raditz came to earth to get goku to join him and the other two remaining saiyans and he wont accept a refusal  
in order to get goku to join him raditz kidnaps gohan and orders goku to kill 100 earthlings before the next day goku tries to stop him but not even he could stop his brothers power even though hes no match for him goku will do whatever it takes to save his son krillin and roshi volunteer to join goku and save gohan however goku refuses he tells them that once the eternal dragon grants a wish he will not grant it again hence the two cannot be resurrected again suddenly piccolo appears and proposes that he and goku team up in order to stop raditz he had seen raditzs power while the saiyan was looking for goku and he knows that neither of them are a match for this alien raditz returns to the location of his landing pod leaving gohan imprisoned in it his scouter detects a large power level coming from gohan but ignores it thinking that its malfunctioning using the dragon radar to find gohan with a dragon ball on his hat and raditz goku and piccolo arrive and shed their equipment unknowingly raising their power levels  
goku and piccolo throw everything theyve got against raditz but it seems that even their combined power stops short of raditzs own strength both get injured and piccolo even loses an arm however piccolo has an idea that might beat him the special beam cannon his newest and most powerful technique but he has to power up to make it work he requires five minutes to gather the strength and goku does his best to give him that despite the fact that the two drastically raise their power levels with heavy concentration they do not manage to defeat raditz using their attacks suddenly goku does manage to grab raditzs tail instantly weakening him raditz surrenders and goku releases his tail however raditz quickly attacks goku again elbowing him in the face and crushing his chest as raditz prepares to kill goku he suddenly picks up an enormous power level coming from gohan  
as raditz tortures goku gohan bursts out of raditzs spaceship and hurls himself into raditz with incredible power that stuns and injures the saiyan however gohans power disappears as quickly as it surfaced leaving him defenseless against his fathers attacker who quickly hits gohan knocking him out raditz intends to kill gohan who he views as the only person capable of defeating him in a last-ditch effort to save his son goku gets raditz in a hold that leaves both of them open to piccolos special beam cannon goku urges piccolo to use it even if it costs his own life piccolo then starts to wonder whether or not he should use it despite raditzs pleas for mercy piccolo lets loose his attack which kills both goku and raditz thinking theyve already won piccolo tells raditz whos slowly dying about the dragon balls once hes heard everything raditz tells piccolo that his scouter is also a transmitter and that in one years time two more saiyans more powerful than raditz will arrive on earth to avenge his murder goku lives to see bulma roshi and krillin arrive and hear that the unconscious gohan is alive but thereafter dies his body taken by kami far away in another planet nappa and vegeta plan to visit earth and wish for immortality using the dragon balls  
to prepare for this threat kami takes goku to the other world for training with the legendary martial arts master king kai but in order to get to king kai first he must cross a treacherous path called snake way only one person has ever successfully crossed it king yemma king yemma tells goku not to fall off snake way or he will never return goku starts the long journey by flying over the path until eventually he runs out of energy and must continue on foot back on planet earth piccolo regnerates his arm and decides to take gohan whos still unconscious under his wing with the hope of tapping into his hidden power piccolo awakens the boy and forces him to train using fear bulma studies the circuitry of raditzs scouter and agrees with master roshi that krillin should be the one to tell chi chi the recent news of goku and gohan  
piccolo leaves gohan alone in the wilderness for six months so he can learn to take care of himself just like his father did as a child even though there are dangerous animals in the wild gohans hidden powers help him escape but also get him stuck on a really tall boulder from which he cant get down high above kami tells mr popo that in a years time both he and piccolo will die from unknown causes and that if piccolo knew this it might have been what caused his slow change of heart towards gohan meanwhile krillin tries to break the news about goku and gohan to chi chi but is too scared  
as krillin and the others try to find the dragon balls after bulma adjusts the eyepiece for their use chi chi arrives with her father to search for goku and gohan there master roshi is forced to tell chi chi the truth himself to which she faints yajirobe appears with a task for krillin he must bring yamcha tien and chiaotzu to korin tower in preparation for the saiyans arrival before he leaves he also tells them that baba is coming to tell them that goku wishes to be brought back just before the saiyans arrival meanwhile at night gohan sees the full moon for the first time and goes through the same transformation as his father once did he becomes a giant ape-like creature an oozaru unable to control his power with no other way to stop the rampaging gohan piccolo is forced to destroy the moon gohan reverts to his normal naked form and with no moon the chance of the transformation ever happening again is gone just to be safe piccolo pulls gohans tail off before giving him new clothes with his symbol on it and a sword finally piccolo again leaves gohan by himself  
after waking up from his transformation gohan finds his tail gone and a new set of clothes that resemble his fathers gi but he has no time to figure out what happened as hungry animals descend upon him gohan escapes but falls into a cave where he finds an ancient capsule corp robot thats been trapped for over 30 years and its not too pleased about having company wanting to escape the cave he seeks the robot for help but its not interested however the robot lets out his soft side and helps gohan get some mushrooms to eat later when gohan tries to help the robot escape the cave starts collapsing and the robot helps him throwing him to safety  
krillin and bulma find yamcha and puar krillin tells yamcha of the important news and start heading to korin tower on the capsule corp ship with the others as gohan becomes more like his father in bravery power and benevolence he finds a wounded dinosaur and aids it in recovering he then defends it from a hungry predator  
goku continues his seemingly endless journey on snake way deep in space the saiyan warriors vegeta and nappa make a stop on a planet called arlia and become prisoners to their tyrant king when they are called before the king they break their bonds and kill the guards the king summons his giant monster on them but they easily take care of them both the other arlians are grateful of the saiyans for killing their tyrant king they proclaim that vegeta and nappa will always receive a heros welcome on arlia despite all of this vegeta destroys the entire planet  
gohan trains hard in the wilderness while piccolo trains himself meanwhile krillin and bulma are still trying to find tien and chiaotzu so they can begin training with kami unfortunately for tien and chiaotzu launch isnt very willing to part with her company  
goku accidentally falls from snake way into hell where he finds a fruit tree goku is famished so he tries to take a piece however the tree belongs to king yemma and the two oni there goz and mez will do anything it takes to stop goku from acquiring the fruit they explain that it is a special fruit that will keep whoever eats it full for a long time goz and mez have their own tests to give the first wasnt very successful even though he won but the second was to their great surprise goku wins the race frustrated they direct goku to a shortcut back to snake way goku reveals that he has stolen a piece of fruit from the tree unfortunately this leads back to king yemma and goku must start all over however after eating the fruit he is much faster and will not get as tired  
even though goku has to start all over on snake way he quickly catches up to where he was last thanks to king yemmas fruit he sees a castle in up ahead and assumes it must belong to king kai he enters the castle only to find out that it belongs to princess snake the princess finds goku very attractive so she does everything she can to keep him there goku tries several times to leave but finally she is forced to show her true form in her new horrible form she captures goku but he is able to break free and continue down snake way  
piccolo splits himself in half and the two forms fight each other piccolo uses this method to train by himself at a high intensity meanwhile gohan sleds down a sandy hill after he crashes he tries to find a way out of wherever he is to his mother he thinks his home is close by after coming to the same spot he originally was at first he realizes he must be on an island brainstorming he builds a boat so he can pay a quick visit to his mother whom he misses as he drifts on the sea at night a huge storm is heading gohans way and he cant swim  
gohan was able to survive the storm and he washes up on the shore there he finds a group of orphans living on their own the adults in the area are trying to capture them and take them to an orphanage after telling them his goal pigero their leader designs a plan to get gohan home and get all of the orphans to a safe location the adults come and pigero and gohan are able to defend themselves against the adults but pigero suddenly realizes something the children will be better off at the orphanage knowing this he lets the adults capture the other orphans he takes gohan to the woods near his house and then drives off gohan gets within sight of his home but decides not to go in he knows how important it is that he train for the saiyans piccolo hovering above him sees all of this and takes gohan back  
gohans real training is about to begin as piccolo trains him in the martial arts on kamis lookout yamcha tien krillin and chiaotzu want to get the same training as goku did so mr popo takes them to the pendulum room where the past present and future intertwine krillin and the others use the room and are sent to planet vegeta in the past facing two powerful saiyan warriors after a horrifying battle the z fighters continue their training with more motivation  
after a rough day of training with piccolo gohan rests for the next day gohan has a bad dream involving raditz beating his father and he suddenly wakes up gohan looks up at the moon which has mysteriously reappeared and overcome by his nightmares of gokus death he losts control of himself and attacks piccolo who arrived to see whats going on piccolo does his best to stop him but once gohan grew his tail back sees the moon and transformed into the oozaru he was powerless to stop him piccolo tries to destroy the moon but finds that it is a projection from gokus old spaceship piccolo destroys the ship reversing the transformation meanwhile after a long trip goku finally makes it to king kais planet and finds a friendly little monkey whom he believes to be king kai  
as gohans training gets harder every day gokus training with king kai has just begun he has about 88 days to prepare for the saiyans it turns out that the monkey is not king kai but it is his pet his first task is to catch the monkey whose name is bubbles but its not going to be easy the gravity on this tiny planet is 10 times that of earth making it hard for goku to even stand up just when goku is losing hope he gets inspired after learning that his people withstand different fighting conditions after three weeks goku conquers the gravity and catches bubbles  
gokus next task in king kais training is to hit the grasshopper gregory with a heavy mallet after a long chase it seems that goku cant hit gregory yet while taking a break king kai tells goku about the saiyan people they were a warrior race who shared a planet with the smarter though weaker tuffles eventually the saiyans overpowered the tuffles and stole their technology willing to stop the saiyans from destroying earth goku continues his training and manages to hit gregory now king kai will train goku himself in the ways of the kaio-ken  
after 70 days of hard training with king kai goku has gotten much stronger and faster but the saiyans are going to arrive the next day so goku speaks to master roshi telepathically through king kai he asks him to use the dragon balls to wish him back suddenly king kai realizes that he forgot to account for the time it will take goku to go back down snake way with no time to waste goku leaves king kais planet and races down snake way  
after a year of space travel the two saiyans vegeta and nappa arrive on earth to celebrate their arrival nappa completely destroys east city with ease by creating an energy blast sensing their power the z fighters mobilize for an attack the saiyans search for any large power levels with their scouters and they head toward piccolo and gohan just when krillin shows up to help the saiyans also arrive piccolo learns that he is a namekian because vegeta recognizes the green skin that is typical of namekians yajirobe knows the threat as well but instead of stopping them he is posing as the leader of the earths special forces to get food  
just to have some fun vegeta and nappa grow some weird creatures called saibamen to test their opponents strength suddenly tien chiaotzu and yamcha arrive to join the battle tien is the first to go up against one of the saibamen thanks to his training tien easily beats one of them angry at his failure vegeta destroys the losing saibaman yamcha is up against the next saibaman and it seems he too is stronger but his opponent grabs yamcha and self-destructs killing them both  
yamcha has been killed by the saibamans surprise explosion back at the kame house everyone mourns his death especially bulma and puar angered by losing him krillin fights the remaining saibamen he fires a powerful energy attack that completely destroys the remaining saibamen however the real battle is about to begin because the saiyan nappa steps up to fight nappa is clearly much stronger than any of them  
as tien gets beaten up by nappa chiaotzu latches on to nappas back and explodes after a telepathic goodbye to tien as the smoke clears it is discovered nappa has only been slightly wounded by chiaotzus attack piccolo and krillin do their best against nappa but the saiyan is much too strong for them using all the power he has tien fires an attack to avenge his fallen friend but it is still not enough to stop the rampaging nappa even though the attack had no effect tien dies of exhaustion claiming that he has failed  
with tien gone only piccolo krillin and gohan are left to fight and they begin to wonder when goku will show up they tell vegeta that goku is far more powerful than any of them and the saiyan prince cant resist the thought of a better fight as he has grown bored of the relatively weak earthlings he tells nappa that they will wait three hours for goku but instead of standing around for three hours nappa flies around the world destroying everything in his path to kill some time goku arrives on earth but he is far away from the battlefield the three hours are up so vegeta tells nappa to continue the fight  
as goku heads toward the battlefield piccolo krillin and gohan devise a plan to stop nappa they plan to pull his tail which will weaken him enough to take him out as piccolo grabs nappas tail gohan rushes to finish the fight however it seems that nappa and vegeta have evolved past their weaknesses and they are no longer crippled when their tail is pulled with their plan a failure nappa begins to pound on piccolo and krillin only gohan is left to fight and the young saiyan is holding his own against nappa enraged by gohans attack nappa fires a blast at gohan that could finish him off  
 
to save his only friend piccolo makes the ultimate sacrifice and dives in front of gohan to block nappas attack as piccolo dies he tells gohan that he is his only friend and how sorry he was about going so hard on him during training with piccolo dead kami and the dragon balls are also gone meaning that no one can be wished back when all hope seems lost for earth goku finally arrives after giving gohan and krillin a senzu bean goku learns what happened to his friends angered goku takes out his frustration on the hulking nappa 
this features the its over 9000 quote as seen when vegeta crushes his scouter due to gokus power level which has made a cultural impact after its views on youtube  
goku is able to easily beat nappa thanks to king kais training with a measured power level in the thousands he is vastly superior to the man who so easily defeated his friends goku avenges all of his friends having seen enough of the fight vegeta orders nappa to stop and let him fight goku to have some more fun nappa decides to attack gohan and krillin only to be stopped by gokus kaio-ken attack unable to move nappa asks vegeta for help but the cruel prince does not tolerate weakness he kills his partner  
goku instructs krillin and gohan to leave the battlefield because he doesnt want them to get hurt with no one in their way goku and vegeta begin their fight for the fate of the earth even with goku using his kaio-ken technique vegeta is still more powerful goku has no choice but to try a kaio-ken x2 but even with this increase in power he still cant overpower vegeta his only choice is to try a kaio-ken x3 but the incredible surge in power could destroy his body  
thanks to the kaio-ken x3 technique goku has the upper hand against vegeta but the saiyan prince will not give up so easily he decides that if he cant beat goku he will destroy the earth he flies high up in the air and fires his galick gun attack goku unleashes the kamehameha wave and the two energy blasts meet in midair goku and vegeta pour all of their energy into this attack and after a long struggle vegetas blast is pushing gokus back even with goku using the kaio-ken x3 attack with no choice left goku uses a kaio-ken x4 attack and with the extra power he is able to blast vegeta into space vegeta is able to recover and flies back down to earth goku is completely spent and vegeta claims to have a trick up his sleeve meanwhile krillin and gohan feel the tremendous surge in energy coming from the battlefield and decide to head back  
by creating an artificial moon with a specialized ball of energy vegeta transforms into the oozaru but unlike most other saiyans he has complete control of himself while in this transformed state luckily goku has one last attack that could finish vegeta the spirit bomb as gohan and krillin return to the battlefield goku is able to create the bomb vegeta however is able to prevent goku from using it with no energy left goku is now at the mercy of vegeta  
gohan and krillin arrive at the battlefield but have to be quick to save goku who is being pounded mercilessly krillin devises a plan to stop vegeta cut off the saiyan princes tail as krillin prepares to fire the destructo disk and gohan distracts vegeta but the saiyan prince is too smart for their tricks and foils their plot suddenly yajirobe appears out of nowhere and cuts vegetas tail off vegeta reverts to his normal form but he is still too powerful to be stopped by the remaining z fighters  
as gohan fights against vegeta goku gives krillin the part of the spirit bomb that he was able to save as krillin prepares to unleash the ball king kai says not to use his eyes to throw it but to feel it out sensing the right moment krillin fires the bomb but vegeta is able to dodge it goku telepathically communicates with gohan telling his son to redirect the blast at vegeta who has jumped into the air gohan is able to aim it directly at vegeta and lands a direct hit however vegeta falls back down to earth and recovers from the blast he blew away the z fighters with a giant explosion of energy but finds that they withstood the blast separated from each other vegeta is about to destroy them when he notices in horror that gohans tail has grown back  
vegeta attempted to rip off gohans tail to prevent him from looking at his artificial moon and transform when yajirobe jumps in and stops him by cutting through his armor with his sword resulting a heroic distraction gohan recovers and then on gokus telepathic commands he looks at vegetas artificial moon and transforms into the oozaru however unlike vegeta gohan cant control himself in this state but quickly stopped by goku and krillins cries for him to defeat vegeta gohan quickly regain control of himself and resumes the fight pounding on vegeta vegeta is able to cut off gohans tail in midair but as gohan falls to earth he lands on vegeta and crushes him before finally reverting back to his normal form vegeta pulls out his remote and summons his spaceship as he crawls toward it krillin attempts to kill him with yajirobes sword goku tells him to stop and let vegeta go his life spared vegeta promises the z fighters revenge when he will return as he leaves the earth in his spaceship for good the battle with the vegeta is over  
the exhausted goku krillin and gohan won their battle and bulma chi chi and the others arrive to help their friends learning of the death of yamcha chiaotzu tien piccolo and kami the z fighters were upset because without the dragon balls the others cant be wished back to life again but krillin has an idea he overheard vegeta saying that it was the nameks who created the dragon balls so they decide to go to the planet namek the only problem is that it will take 43392516 years to reach namek they decide to use nappas spaceship because saiyan spaceships travel much faster  
bulma destroys the saiyan ship by accidentally pressing the self-destruct button on its remote mr popo arrives and tells them that he knows of another spaceship its the namekian ship that kami used to come to earth when he was a boy hesitant but willing bulma goes with mr popo despite her fear over him  
because the ship works on voice commands given in the namekian language mr popo teaches bulma a little of the language so she can operate the spaceship meanwhile goku krillin and gohan recover from their wounds because gokus injuries are worse he has to stay in the hospital after gohan and krillin are completely recovered gohan and krillin decide to accompany bulma on her journey to planet namek  
gohan krillin and bulma blast off to namek on the way they run into what appears to be an invisible spaceship they enter the ship only to discover that its full of traps after getting through what seemed to be all the traps bulma gohan and krillin feast on a table - full of food they soon figured out that was a mistake after the children with guns holding bulma hostage came into the picture  


 japan 
gohan and the others are captured by a band of space pirates for they think they are the lackies of a villain named frieza who sent some of his forces to take over their planet long ago suddenly the station heads into an asteroid field and bulma runs toward the cockpit she pushes the pilot out of the way and guides the ship out of the asteroids safely after realizing that theyre not enemies the pirates let gohan krillin and bulma go  
thanks to the kids help bulma uses a shortcut to get to namek after a crash landing on the planets surface two namekians nurse them back to health they offer to help the three in their search for the dragon balls  
as they continue their search for the dragon balls with the namekians help they get closer and closer to attaining all seven back on earth goku escapes from the hospital and begins training meanwhile vegetas ship has reached its destination and doctors have begun their work on him  
gohan krillin and bulma are one dragon ball away from making their wish but during their search for the seventh dragon ball their two namekian friends reveal that they are not namekians at all in fact theyre not even on namek meanwhile vegeta learns that frieza has traveled to namek to gather the dragon balls not wanting to be beaten to the punch vegeta immediately blasts off for namek  
the two namekians reveal that they have been stuck on this planet since their ship broke down and they have been planning to steal bulmas ship they read their minds after her ship crashed and so they projected images of namekians over their true forms gohan bulma and krillin however are able to escape the clutches of the two aliens and continue their trip to namek after a long journey gohan and the others celebrate their arrival on namek but their party is cut short by the arrival of vegeta however hes not even their worst problem because frieza is also on namek  
frieza and his henchmen are already in possession of four dragon balls freiza has learned of vegetas arrival so he sends one of his henchmen cui after him meanwhile gohan and krillin sees two of friezas henchmen looking for the dragon balls but they get beaten up easily cui believes that he is stronger than vegeta but hasnt calculated vegetas power after his time on earth the two engage in battle but cui is destroyed effortlessly  
with bulma safely hiding in a cave gohan and krillin fly to the nearby namek village to investigate crouching behind a rock they see frieza and his henchmen trying to steal the fifth dragon ball back on earth master roshi tells goku everything that happened on namek and asks for gokus help but hes still not healed yet yajirobe arrives with a bag of senzu beans for goku now that hes healed he flies to capsule corp where dr brief has made a replica of his spaceship which includes a gravity chamber to train in on his way to namek goku immediately blasts off for namek  
the evil frieza and his henchmen try to persuade the namekian elder of the village to hand over the dragon ball by killing most of the villagers gohan who cant watch the innocent namekians get murdered anymore is about to fly in and save them when three more namekians appear these three are strong enough to defeat friezas weaker henchmen so the evil tyrant sends one of his best fighters dodoria after them  
dodoria steps in to fight and he easily kills the namekian warriors with no other choice the elder gives the fifth ball to frieza but despite his cooperation he and the namekian boy cargo are killed before dodoria can finish off the last namekian boy gohan loses control and steps in to save him he grabs the boy and takes off with krillin at his side dodoria speeds off after them  
by using tiens solar flare technique krillin gohan and the namekian boy dende are able to escape from dodoria as the pink alien tries to get back to frieza vegeta shows up ready to settle the score between him and dodoria dodoria is taken by surprise by vegetas new strength and the saiyan prince easily overpowers him pleading for his life dodoria barters information for his freedom he tells vegeta that it was actually frieza not an asteroid that destroyed planet vegeta although taken aback at this new revelation he kills dodoria anyway  
with vegeta stronger and frieza afoot krillin is having doubts if he and the others will be able to collect the dragon balls bulma hears from her father that goku is already on his way to namek meanwhile goku is training aboard his spaceship at 20x the earths gravity suddenly an asteroid collides with his ship which aims it directly into a star goku is forced to summon every ounce of strength that he has in order to blast his ship back on course no longer needing a scouter to sense energy vegeta quickly finds the next dragon ball for good measure he wipes out the entire village as well he then hides the dragon ball in the water nearby for safekeeping sensing the nearby destruction krillin and gohan deduce that vegeta has found the sixth dragon ball  
with only one left dende and krillin take off toward the namekian leader guru it is this eldest namekian who holds the seventh dragon ball meanwhile king kai tells goku that his friends have made it to his place and to not face frieza  
as goku steps up his training king kai tells him that yamcha tien chiaotzu and piccolo have come to train with him however king kai has discovered that frieza is on namek and warns goku not go near him back on namek as krillin and dende head towards the eldest namek zarbon one of friezas high-level henchmen finds vegeta and intends to destroy him vegeta shows off his newfound strength by easily beating him up however zarbon claims he has a trick up his sleeve  
realizing he is no match for vegetas increased power zarbon has no choice but to reveal his true power transforming into a hideous reptilian beast in this form he is far more powerful and begins to pound vegeta with a mighty stroke he blasts vegeta to the bottom of a lake and he is presumed dead  
once they finally arrive at their destination krillin and dende meet the eldest namek guru and his bodyguard nail who closely resembles piccolo the wise old namekian gives krillin the last dragon ball and upon seeing that he is pure-hearted unlike frieza also awakens hidden powers within him as krillin heads back to the others zarbon informs frieza that he killed vegeta when frieza finds out that zarbon only assumes that vegeta is dead he makes him go back and find vegeta zarbon arrives at their battle site pulls vegeta out of the water and brings him back to friezas ship dende arrives and tells nail what has happened  
as goku trains harder for namek yamcha tien and chiaotzu complete king kais first test even piccolo helps out on the second test back on namek friezas men are working to revive vegeta but hes still unconscious from his battle with zarbon meanwhile krillin is still on his way back to gohan and bulma  
vegeta has recovered and with no one watching him he breaks out of his medical chamber and hides he creates a diversion to get frieza and zarbon away from the five dragon balls he goes into the main control room that contains the dragon balls blasts a hole in the ship and escapes furious over the loss of the dragon balls frieza orders zarbon to find vegeta and the dragon balls in one hour or he will die vegeta finds a suitable hiding spot for the five dragon balls he knows that frieza and his henchmen have no scouters and cant sense energy signals so they wont be able to find the five balls without combing the entire surface of the planet  
gohan suddenly senses an energy signal from the village that vegeta destroyed earlier and goes to check it out krillin arrives back at the cave to give bulma the good news however zarbon and vegeta followed him they see that he has a dragon ball and they decide to fight each other for it zarbon thinks that the fight will be as easy as it was the last time but he doesnt know that a saiyans strength increases after he recovers from injury and vegeta makes short work of him he then takes krillins dragon ball back to where he hid the other five meanwhile gokus ship hits a magnetic storm which makes the gravity machine malfunction causing it to increase the gravity to 100x normal though he can barely move goku sees this as a new challenge and begins to train under the intense gravity  
with both of his main henchmen killed by vegeta frieza summons his elite fighting squad the ginyu force meanwhile gohan finds the dragon ball vegeta hid underwater and heads back to the cave with it however he notices vegeta on his way back and drops to the ground hiding until vegeta threatens to blow the surrounding area to pieces gohan reveals himself and is able to keep vegeta from realizing that the last dragon ball is hiding right behind him amazed at his luck gohan brings the dragon ball back to krillin and bulma he and krillin then take off toward gurus place leaving the dragon ball in bulmas possession they hope that guru will awaken gohans hidden power vegeta returns to the village and discovers his dragon ball is missing and realizes that gohan had taken it also he draws a conclusion about the dragon radar furious he returns to the cave but was too late as gohan krillin and bulma had already left  
as gohan and krillin head to gurus place to awaken gohans hidden powers they leave bulma behind to look after the dragon ball frustrated at his loss of five of the dragon balls frieza begins firing powerful energy blasts all over the surface of namek these explosions cause the dragon ball to roll away from bulma and into the water nearby bulma takes her submarine into the water to find the lost ball but there she finds more than she bargained for as she reaches for the ball a giant crab thinks she is trying to steal her eggs and begins to attack bulma bulma saves the crab from a falling rock and the crab gives her the dragon ball  
bulma finally retrieves the dragon ball only to be captured by two of friezas henchmen she persuades them into find the rest of the dragon balls and making a wish themselves knowing she has more dragon ball knowledge than the two of them they take her along she leads them into the water and right to the giant crab who eats both of them  
krillin and gohan finally make it to gurus place but vegeta has followed them determined to get the last dragon ball as krillin tries to hold off vegeta gohan has his hidden powers unleashed suddenly they all sense an incredibly powerful force arriving on the planet vegeta recognizes it as the ginyu force he tells krillin and gohan that the ginyu force is far more powerful even than he is vegeta says that if they are to defeat them and prevent frieza from making his wish they must work together  
the ginyu force arrives on namek they are five incredibly powerful warriors named guldo jeice recoome burter and captain ginyu these five fighters specialize in making flashy poses frieza tells them what the dragon balls are and sends them after vegeta he tells captain ginyu to use his scouter to find the dragon balls while the other four deal with vegeta meanwhile krillin is very reluctant to join forces with vegeta but gohan knows that goku would do it so he convinces krillin to help the ginyu force quickly finds where vegeta and the others are and are prepared to fight  
the weakest member of the ginyu force guldo steps up to fight against the powered up krillin and gohan guldo quickly discovers that both krillin and gohan are far more powerful than he is so he uses his special technique he holds his breath stopping time krillin and gohan swoop in for the final blow several times but every time guldo stops time and runs to a different location he then reveals another trick he uses his mysterious power to completely bind krillin and gohan unable to move they are at the mercy of guldo having seen enough vegeta steps in and quickly annihilates guldo  
the next fighter from the ginyu force is the massive recoome vegeta pulls out all the stops but he is no match for recoome the giant begins to toy with vegeta despite the pleas from the remaining members of the ginyu force with vegeta out of commission krillin steps in to save him though he does his best he is easily defeated  
since krillin and vegeta cant fight anymore gohan is the only one left to fight captain ginyu leader of the force locates all seven dragon balls and brings them to frieza frieza tries to make his wish but realizes he doesnt know what to do he figures there must be a password meanwhile gohan gives it everything he has against recoome but the giant warrior is too strong just as he is about to finish off gohan everyone senses a gigantic power arriving on the planet krillin gohan and vegeta realize it is goku  
goku has finally arrived on namek and finds krillin gohan and vegeta near death he gives them all a senzu bean and prepares to fight the ginyu force with a single blow to the gut he puts recoome out of commission gokus training at 100x normal gravity has exponentially increased his strength  
with recoome beaten by one punch the remaining two ginyu force members burter and jeice fight against goku but none of their speed attacks work against him they try to hit him but their punches seem to go through goku he is dodging so fast that it appears he isnt even moving vegeta believes that goku has become the legendary saiyan warrior the super saiyan if this is true goku would be the first super saiyan in millennia  
goku easily beats burter frightened jeice flies away to get captain ginyu vegeta then executes both recoome and burter despite gokus pleas meanwhile frieza heads off towards gurus place hoping to discover the secret to using the dragon balls goku vegeta krillin and gohan all sense that frieza is on the move but the dragon balls remain in their place they recognize that this might be their only chance to make their wish  
once captain ginyu arrives vegeta leaves goku behind to get the dragon balls for himself krillin and gohan leave to get the dragon radar from bulma so they can find the balls before vegeta jeice tells captain ginyu how powerful goku is but the captain is confident he can beat him goku decides to skip the warmup and power up to his full strength immediately as he is powering up jeice measures his power level on his scanner he is shocked as the level continues to climb higher and higher eventually surpassing captain ginyus maximum captain ginyu doesnt believe the scanner and begins to fight with goku  
goku is obviously more powerful than ginyu but the captain wont give up so easily meanwhile guru sends dende to tell krillin and gohan the password to use the dragon balls frieza arrives at gurus place demanding to know the dragon balls password the last three namekians arrive as well but despite nails pleas they about to fight frieza but the tyrant easily kills them though nail informs him that the dragon balls would disappear following gurus death frieza confronts guru to get the password anyway  
nail leads frieza away from gurus place so that he cant get hurt he starts fighting frieza but it seems that he was unable to hold him up though he does to give time for dende to deliver the dragon balls password to  gohan and krillin get the dragon radar from bulma and head towards friezas spaceship meanwhile goku is winning his fight against captain ginyu realizing he cant win captain ginyu decides to use his special power the body change he severely wounded himself to gokus horror and shoots a beam of light out of his mouth and into gokus the two switch bodies ginyu as goku then flies back towards friezas spaceship leaving goku in ginyus thrashed body behind  
krillin and gohan arrive at friezas spaceship and locate the dragon balls unaware that vegeta is not far away as the two try to figure out what the password is jeice and captain ginyu in gokus body arrive as well the disguised ginyu tries to trick krillin into believing that he is goku gohan however realizes that it is not the real goku goku in captain ginyus destroyed body arrives and tells krillin and gohan what happened now it is up to gohan to defeat captain ginyu  
ginyu tries to power up with gokus body but it turns out what gokus right was that he cant reach its full potential because he doesnt know how to unite body and mind but even at a relatively low power he can still overpower both krillin and gohan vegeta arrives and begins to fight jeice having recovered from severe injury vegeta has greatly increased his power and easily overpowers and kills jeice  
realizing that hes no match for the renewed vegeta captain ginyu decides to use his body-switching trick on him once again he lets his body get thrashed so his opponent will be very weak after the switch just as captain ginyu uses the trick goku recognizes the move and intercepts the light beam switching back into his old body back in his broken body captain ginyu tries to switch with vegeta again goku throws a frog to intercept the transfer the frog in ginyus body hops into the water while ginyu in the frogs body flees with the ginyu force defeated goku recovers in an isolation chamber in friezas spaceship vegeta finds two pairs of saiyan armor for krillin and gohan to wear in their upcoming fight with frieza

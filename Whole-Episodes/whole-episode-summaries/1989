five years have passed since gokus victory at the 23rd world martial arts tournament gokus son gohan is wandering around the woods outside of his house when a tiger steals his hat while hes looking for the tiger he accidentally falls into a river goku searching for his son finds his hat he suddenly sees gohan floating down a river but he cant reach him in time before he goes over a waterfall goku looks up and sees gohan clinging to a branch having somehow jumped out of the river with gohan safe they head to master roshis house meanwhile a mysterious alien has arrived on earth looking for a man named kakarrot with a special device the scouter he wears on his head he searches for high power levels on earth he finds piccolo whose attack is completely ineffective the alien is about to devastate piccolo when he finds a higher power level and flies off  
goku and gohan arrive at master roshis island to meet bulma krillin master roshi and turtle quickly the others notice the difference between gohans behavior and that of goku as a child goku informs his friends that chi chi refuses to allow gohan to fight instead he studies constantly the same mysterious alien arrives at the island and reveals himself he is a saiyan warrior named raditz and he is gokus older brother he also reveals that gokus real saiyan name is kakarrot goku learns that he was sent to destroy all life on earth but his memory loss from a terrible fall as a child prevented this outcome raditz came to earth to get goku to join him and the other two remaining saiyans and he wont accept a refusal  
in order to get goku to join him raditz kidnaps gohan and orders goku to kill 100 earthlings before the next day goku tries to stop him but not even he could stop his brothers power even though hes no match for him goku will do whatever it takes to save his son krillin and roshi volunteer to join goku and save gohan however goku refuses he tells them that once the eternal dragon grants a wish he will not grant it again hence the two cannot be resurrected again suddenly piccolo appears and proposes that he and goku team up in order to stop raditz he had seen raditzs power while the saiyan was looking for goku and he knows that neither of them are a match for this alien raditz returns to the location of his landing pod leaving gohan imprisoned in it his scouter detects a large power level coming from gohan but ignores it thinking that its malfunctioning using the dragon radar to find gohan with a dragon ball on his hat and raditz goku and piccolo arrive and shed their equipment unknowingly raising their power levels  
goku and piccolo throw everything theyve got against raditz but it seems that even their combined power stops short of raditzs own strength both get injured and piccolo even loses an arm however piccolo has an idea that might beat him the special beam cannon his newest and most powerful technique but he has to power up to make it work he requires five minutes to gather the strength and goku does his best to give him that despite the fact that the two drastically raise their power levels with heavy concentration they do not manage to defeat raditz using their attacks suddenly goku does manage to grab raditzs tail instantly weakening him raditz surrenders and goku releases his tail however raditz quickly attacks goku again elbowing him in the face and crushing his chest as raditz prepares to kill goku he suddenly picks up an enormous power level coming from gohan  
as raditz tortures goku gohan bursts out of raditzs spaceship and hurls himself into raditz with incredible power that stuns and injures the saiyan however gohans power disappears as quickly as it surfaced leaving him defenseless against his fathers attacker who quickly hits gohan knocking him out raditz intends to kill gohan who he views as the only person capable of defeating him in a last-ditch effort to save his son goku gets raditz in a hold that leaves both of them open to piccolos special beam cannon goku urges piccolo to use it even if it costs his own life piccolo then starts to wonder whether or not he should use it despite raditzs pleas for mercy piccolo lets loose his attack which kills both goku and raditz thinking theyve already won piccolo tells raditz whos slowly dying about the dragon balls once hes heard everything raditz tells piccolo that his scouter is also a transmitter and that in one years time two more saiyans more powerful than raditz will arrive on earth to avenge his murder goku lives to see bulma roshi and krillin arrive and hear that the unconscious gohan is alive but thereafter dies his body taken by kami far away in another planet nappa and vegeta plan to visit earth and wish for immortality using the dragon balls  
to prepare for this threat kami takes goku to the other world for training with the legendary martial arts master king kai but in order to get to king kai first he must cross a treacherous path called snake way only one person has ever successfully crossed it king yemma king yemma tells goku not to fall off snake way or he will never return goku starts the long journey by flying over the path until eventually he runs out of energy and must continue on foot back on planet earth piccolo regnerates his arm and decides to take gohan whos still unconscious under his wing with the hope of tapping into his hidden power piccolo awakens the boy and forces him to train using fear bulma studies the circuitry of raditzs scouter and agrees with master roshi that krillin should be the one to tell chi chi the recent news of goku and gohan  
piccolo leaves gohan alone in the wilderness for six months so he can learn to take care of himself just like his father did as a child even though there are dangerous animals in the wild gohans hidden powers help him escape but also get him stuck on a really tall boulder from which he cant get down high above kami tells mr popo that in a years time both he and piccolo will die from unknown causes and that if piccolo knew this it might have been what caused his slow change of heart towards gohan meanwhile krillin tries to break the news about goku and gohan to chi chi but is too scared  
as krillin and the others try to find the dragon balls after bulma adjusts the eyepiece for their use chi chi arrives with her father to search for goku and gohan there master roshi is forced to tell chi chi the truth himself to which she faints yajirobe appears with a task for krillin he must bring yamcha tien and chiaotzu to korin tower in preparation for the saiyans arrival before he leaves he also tells them that baba is coming to tell them that goku wishes to be brought back just before the saiyans arrival meanwhile at night gohan sees the full moon for the first time and goes through the same transformation as his father once did he becomes a giant ape-like creature an oozaru unable to control his power with no other way to stop the rampaging gohan piccolo is forced to destroy the moon gohan reverts to his normal naked form and with no moon the chance of the transformation ever happening again is gone just to be safe piccolo pulls gohans tail off before giving him new clothes with his symbol on it and a sword finally piccolo again leaves gohan by himself  
after waking up from his transformation gohan finds his tail gone and a new set of clothes that resemble his fathers gi but he has no time to figure out what happened as hungry animals descend upon him gohan escapes but falls into a cave where he finds an ancient capsule corp robot thats been trapped for over 30 years and its not too pleased about having company wanting to escape the cave he seeks the robot for help but its not interested however the robot lets out his soft side and helps gohan get some mushrooms to eat later when gohan tries to help the robot escape the cave starts collapsing and the robot helps him throwing him to safety  
krillin and bulma find yamcha and puar krillin tells yamcha of the important news and start heading to korin tower on the capsule corp ship with the others as gohan becomes more like his father in bravery power and benevolence he finds a wounded dinosaur and aids it in recovering he then defends it from a hungry predator  
goku continues his seemingly endless journey on snake way deep in space the saiyan warriors vegeta and nappa make a stop on a planet called arlia and become prisoners to their tyrant king when they are called before the king they break their bonds and kill the guards the king summons his giant monster on them but they easily take care of them both the other arlians are grateful of the saiyans for killing their tyrant king they proclaim that vegeta and nappa will always receive a heros welcome on arlia despite all of this vegeta destroys the entire planet  
gohan trains hard in the wilderness while piccolo trains himself meanwhile krillin and bulma are still trying to find tien and chiaotzu so they can begin training with kami unfortunately for tien and chiaotzu launch isnt very willing to part with her company  
goku accidentally falls from snake way into hell where he finds a fruit tree goku is famished so he tries to take a piece however the tree belongs to king yemma and the two oni there goz and mez will do anything it takes to stop goku from acquiring the fruit they explain that it is a special fruit that will keep whoever eats it full for a long time goz and mez have their own tests to give the first wasnt very successful even though he won but the second was to their great surprise goku wins the race frustrated they direct goku to a shortcut back to snake way goku reveals that he has stolen a piece of fruit from the tree unfortunately this leads back to king yemma and goku must start all over however after eating the fruit he is much faster and will not get as tired  
even though goku has to start all over on snake way he quickly catches up to where he was last thanks to king yemmas fruit he sees a castle in up ahead and assumes it must belong to king kai he enters the castle only to find out that it belongs to princess snake the princess finds goku very attractive so she does everything she can to keep him there goku tries several times to leave but finally she is forced to show her true form in her new horrible form she captures goku but he is able to break free and continue down snake way  
piccolo splits himself in half and the two forms fight each other piccolo uses this method to train by himself at a high intensity meanwhile gohan sleds down a sandy hill after he crashes he tries to find a way out of wherever he is to his mother he thinks his home is close by after coming to the same spot he originally was at first he realizes he must be on an island brainstorming he builds a boat so he can pay a quick visit to his mother whom he misses as he drifts on the sea at night a huge storm is heading gohans way and he cant swim  
gohan was able to survive the storm and he washes up on the shore there he finds a group of orphans living on their own the adults in the area are trying to capture them and take them to an orphanage after telling them his goal pigero their leader designs a plan to get gohan home and get all of the orphans to a safe location the adults come and pigero and gohan are able to defend themselves against the adults but pigero suddenly realizes something the children will be better off at the orphanage knowing this he lets the adults capture the other orphans he takes gohan to the woods near his house and then drives off gohan gets within sight of his home but decides not to go in he knows how important it is that he train for the saiyans piccolo hovering above him sees all of this and takes gohan back  
gohans real training is about to begin as piccolo trains him in the martial arts on kamis lookout yamcha tien krillin and chiaotzu want to get the same training as goku did so mr popo takes them to the pendulum room where the past present and future intertwine krillin and the others use the room and are sent to planet vegeta in the past facing two powerful saiyan warriors after a horrifying battle the z fighters continue their training with more motivation  
after a rough day of training with piccolo gohan rests for the next day gohan has a bad dream involving raditz beating his father and he suddenly wakes up gohan looks up at the moon which has mysteriously reappeared and overcome by his nightmares of gokus death he losts control of himself and attacks piccolo who arrived to see whats going on piccolo does his best to stop him but once gohan grew his tail back sees the moon and transformed into the oozaru he was powerless to stop him piccolo tries to destroy the moon but finds that it is a projection from gokus old spaceship piccolo destroys the ship reversing the transformation meanwhile after a long trip goku finally makes it to king kais planet and finds a friendly little monkey whom he believes to be king kai  
as gohans training gets harder every day gokus training with king kai has just begun he has about 88 days to prepare for the saiyans it turns out that the monkey is not king kai but it is his pet his first task is to catch the monkey whose name is bubbles but its not going to be easy the gravity on this tiny planet is 10 times that of earth making it hard for goku to even stand up just when goku is losing hope he gets inspired after learning that his people withstand different fighting conditions after three weeks goku conquers the gravity and catches bubbles  
gokus next task in king kais training is to hit the grasshopper gregory with a heavy mallet after a long chase it seems that goku cant hit gregory yet while taking a break king kai tells goku about the saiyan people they were a warrior race who shared a planet with the smarter though weaker tuffles eventually the saiyans overpowered the tuffles and stole their technology willing to stop the saiyans from destroying earth goku continues his training and manages to hit gregory now king kai will train goku himself in the ways of the kaio-ken  
after 70 days of hard training with king kai goku has gotten much stronger and faster but the saiyans are going to arrive the next day so goku speaks to master roshi telepathically through king kai he asks him to use the dragon balls to wish him back suddenly king kai realizes that he forgot to account for the time it will take goku to go back down snake way with no time to waste goku leaves king kais planet and races down snake way  
after a year of space travel the two saiyans vegeta and nappa arrive on earth to celebrate their arrival nappa completely destroys east city with ease by creating an energy blast sensing their power the z fighters mobilize for an attack the saiyans search for any large power levels with their scouters and they head toward piccolo and gohan just when krillin shows up to help the saiyans also arrive piccolo learns that he is a namekian because vegeta recognizes the green skin that is typical of namekians yajirobe knows the threat as well but instead of stopping them he is posing as the leader of the earths special forces to get food  
just to have some fun vegeta and nappa grow some weird creatures called saibamen to test their opponents strength suddenly tien chiaotzu and yamcha arrive to join the battle tien is the first to go up against one of the saibamen thanks to his training tien easily beats one of them angry at his failure vegeta destroys the losing saibaman yamcha is up against the next saibaman and it seems he too is stronger but his opponent grabs yamcha and self-destructs killing them both  
yamcha has been killed by the saibamans surprise explosion back at the kame house everyone mourns his death especially bulma and puar angered by losing him krillin fights the remaining saibamen he fires a powerful energy attack that completely destroys the remaining saibamen however the real battle is about to begin because the saiyan nappa steps up to fight nappa is clearly much stronger than any of them  
as tien gets beaten up by nappa chiaotzu latches on to nappas back and explodes after a telepathic goodbye to tien as the smoke clears it is discovered nappa has only been slightly wounded by chiaotzus attack piccolo and krillin do their best against nappa but the saiyan is much too strong for them using all the power he has tien fires an attack to avenge his fallen friend but it is still not enough to stop the rampaging nappa even though the attack had no effect tien dies of exhaustion claiming that he has failed  
with tien gone only piccolo krillin and gohan are left to fight and they begin to wonder when goku will show up they tell vegeta that goku is far more powerful than any of them and the saiyan prince cant resist the thought of a better fight as he has grown bored of the relatively weak earthlings he tells nappa that they will wait three hours for goku but instead of standing around for three hours nappa flies around the world destroying everything in his path to kill some time goku arrives on earth but he is far away from the battlefield the three hours are up so vegeta tells nappa to continue the fight  
as goku heads toward the battlefield piccolo krillin and gohan devise a plan to stop nappa they plan to pull his tail which will weaken him enough to take him out as piccolo grabs nappas tail gohan rushes to finish the fight however it seems that nappa and vegeta have evolved past their weaknesses and they are no longer crippled when their tail is pulled with their plan a failure nappa begins to pound on piccolo and krillin only gohan is left to fight and the young saiyan is holding his own against nappa enraged by gohans attack nappa fires a blast at gohan that could finish him off  
 
to save his only friend piccolo makes the ultimate sacrifice and dives in front of gohan to block nappas attack as piccolo dies he tells gohan that he is his only friend and how sorry he was about going so hard on him during training with piccolo dead kami and the dragon balls are also gone meaning that no one can be wished back when all hope seems lost for earth goku finally arrives after giving gohan and krillin a senzu bean goku learns what happened to his friends angered goku takes out his frustration on the hulking nappa 
this features the its over 9000 quote as seen when vegeta crushes his scouter due to gokus power level which has made a cultural impact after its views on youtube  
goku is able to easily beat nappa thanks to king kais training with a measured power level in the thousands he is vastly superior to the man who so easily defeated his friends goku avenges all of his friends having seen enough of the fight vegeta orders nappa to stop and let him fight goku to have some more fun nappa decides to attack gohan and krillin only to be stopped by gokus kaio-ken attack unable to move nappa asks vegeta for help but the cruel prince does not tolerate weakness he kills his partner  
goku instructs krillin and gohan to leave the battlefield because he doesnt want them to get hurt with no one in their way goku and vegeta begin their fight for the fate of the earth even with goku using his kaio-ken technique vegeta is still more powerful goku has no choice but to try a kaio-ken x2 but even with this increase in power he still cant overpower vegeta his only choice is to try a kaio-ken x3 but the incredible surge in power could destroy his body  
thanks to the kaio-ken x3 technique goku has the upper hand against vegeta but the saiyan prince will not give up so easily he decides that if he cant beat goku he will destroy the earth he flies high up in the air and fires his galick gun attack goku unleashes the kamehameha wave and the two energy blasts meet in midair goku and vegeta pour all of their energy into this attack and after a long struggle vegetas blast is pushing gokus back even with goku using the kaio-ken x3 attack with no choice left goku uses a kaio-ken x4 attack and with the extra power he is able to blast vegeta into space vegeta is able to recover and flies back down to earth goku is completely spent and vegeta claims to have a trick up his sleeve meanwhile krillin and gohan feel the tremendous surge in energy coming from the battlefield and decide to head back  
by creating an artificial moon with a specialized ball of energy vegeta transforms into the oozaru but unlike most other saiyans he has complete control of himself while in this transformed state luckily goku has one last attack that could finish vegeta the spirit bomb as gohan and krillin return to the battlefield goku is able to create the bomb vegeta however is able to prevent goku from using it with no energy left goku is now at the mercy of vegeta  
gohan and krillin arrive at the battlefield but have to be quick to save goku who is being pounded mercilessly krillin devises a plan to stop vegeta cut off the saiyan princes tail as krillin prepares to fire the destructo disk and gohan distracts vegeta but the saiyan prince is too smart for their tricks and foils their plot suddenly yajirobe appears out of nowhere and cuts vegetas tail off vegeta reverts to his normal form but he is still too powerful to be stopped by the remaining z fighters  
as gohan fights against vegeta goku gives krillin the part of the spirit bomb that he was able to save as krillin prepares to unleash the ball king kai says not to use his eyes to throw it but to feel it out sensing the right moment krillin fires the bomb but vegeta is able to dodge it goku telepathically communicates with gohan telling his son to redirect the blast at vegeta who has jumped into the air gohan is able to aim it directly at vegeta and lands a direct hit however vegeta falls back down to earth and recovers from the blast he blew away the z fighters with a giant explosion of energy but finds that they withstood the blast separated from each other vegeta is about to destroy them when he notices in horror that gohans tail has grown back  
vegeta attempted to rip off gohans tail to prevent him from looking at his artificial moon and transform when yajirobe jumps in and stops him by cutting through his armor with his sword resulting a heroic distraction gohan recovers and then on gokus telepathic commands he looks at vegetas artificial moon and transforms into the oozaru however unlike vegeta gohan cant control himself in this state but quickly stopped by goku and krillins cries for him to defeat vegeta gohan quickly regain control of himself and resumes the fight pounding on vegeta vegeta is able to cut off gohans tail in midair but as gohan falls to earth he lands on vegeta and crushes him before finally reverting back to his normal form vegeta pulls out his remote and summons his spaceship as he crawls toward it krillin attempts to kill him with yajirobes sword goku tells him to stop and let vegeta go his life spared vegeta promises the z fighters revenge when he will return as he leaves the earth in his spaceship for good the battle with the vegeta is over  
the exhausted goku krillin and gohan won their battle and bulma chi chi and the others arrive to help their friends learning of the death of yamcha chiaotzu tien piccolo and kami the z fighters were upset because without the dragon balls the others cant be wished back to life again but krillin has an idea he overheard vegeta saying that it was the nameks who created the dragon balls so they decide to go to the planet namek the only problem is that it will take 43392516 years to reach namek they decide to use nappas spaceship because saiyan spaceships travel much faster  
bulma destroys the saiyan ship by accidentally pressing the self-destruct button on its remote mr popo arrives and tells them that he knows of another spaceship its the namekian ship that kami used to come to earth when he was a boy hesitant but willing bulma goes with mr popo despite her fear over him  
because the ship works on voice commands given in the namekian language mr popo teaches bulma a little of the language so she can operate the spaceship meanwhile goku krillin and gohan recover from their wounds because gokus injuries are worse he has to stay in the hospital after gohan and krillin are completely recovered gohan and krillin decide to accompany bulma on her journey to planet namek  
gohan krillin and bulma blast off to namek on the way they run into what appears to be an invisible spaceship they enter the ship only to discover that its full of traps after getting through what seemed to be all the traps bulma gohan and krillin feast on a table - full of food they soon figured out that was a mistake after the children with guns holding bulma hostage came into the picture

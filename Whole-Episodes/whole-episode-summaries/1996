 japan 
the two gunmen proceed to shoot rockets at buus house hercule runs up to the hill theyre on and pounds each of them buu is able to heal the dog and the three friends continue having fun buu rebuilds his house to look like the dog which he names bee while hercule is cooking a meal for buu one of the gunmen sneaks into buus house and shoots the world champ buu starts to lose control of himself after he heals hercule he instructs him to get away buu begins giving off more steam than ever and the steam is congealing in the sky it forms the evil side of buu a tall thin gray version of majin buu evil buu flies over to the gunman and blasts him into oblivion  
evil buu and good buu begin to fight and its clear that evil buu has the advantage good buu becomes desperate and angry and resorts to trying to turn his opponent into chocolate but evil buu deflects the ray back at good buu who becomes a piece of chocolate evil buu consumes the chocolate and transforms into super buu a bulkier pink version of evil buu super buu blows up the other gunman and spies another person hiding nearby he is about to destroy the other person when he realizes that its hercule he spares his friend and flies off he arrives at dendes lookout  
buu demands to fight gotenks but piccolo knows that the boys arent ready to buy time he tells buu that he can spend a day killing the rest of the people on earth buu starts walking around the edge of the lookout and piccolo uses this time to tell krillin to wake up the boys and get them into the hyperbolic time chamber to train buu completes his walk and raises up his arm millions of energy blasts start flying out of his hand down to earth and they kill virtually everyone left after this human extinction attack is finished only hercule the dog bee tien shinhan and chiaotzu remain on the surface as well as the people on the lookout piccolo asks for super buu to wait for one hour and videl agrees buu complies because videl is the daughter of hercule  
chi chi slaps super buu for she thinks he killed gohan and in retaliation buu turns her into an egg and crushes her goten vows to train as hard as he can for what buu did to his mother the boys enter the hyperbolic time chamber and begin to train buus patience wears off after thirty minutes and he demands to fight his opponent right now piccolo reluctantly agrees to take buu to the chamber but he takes the longest route possible giving the boys as much time as he can he telepathically warns them that he is bringing buu to them so they can rest up in time the boys seem to have developed a few new tricks and they have planned their fight with buu finally piccolo and buu arrive at the chamber and goten and trunks fuse together  
super buu and gotenks begin to fight and gotenks decides to use some of his new special moves the problem is that these moves while flashy are ineffective against buu not to mention they have ridiculous names like the screaming angry wombat after it is clear that these moves have no effect gotenks talks strategy with piccolo he then creates a ring of energy the galactic doughnut and uses it to trap buu after a brief struggle buu is able to break the ring the two then do a bit of real fighting gotenks decides to use another one of his special moves called the super ghost kamikaze attack he spits out a ghost of himself and plans to use it against buu  
gotenks creates ten ghosts that detonate with explosive force when they are touched he sends all but one at super buu and they reduce him to a deformed puddle of his former self gotenks sends the final one down buus mouth blowing him into tiny pieces gotenks and piccolo destroy all of the pieces but the smoke coming from the pieces gathers above their heads and reforms super buu to play up the drama of the situation gotenks acts like hes out of ideas and buu begins beating up the fused saiyan thinking that gotenks cannot stop buu piccolo destroys the door to the outside world which traps the three of them in the chamber for all eternity  
hysterically upset at the prospect of being trapped in the hyperbolic time chamber forever with nothing to destroy and no candy to eat super buu starts to scream to everyones surprise including his own his screams become so powerful that they create a hole in the barrier between the dimensions of the chamber and earth buu changes shape in order to fit through it and the hole closes leaving piccolo and gotenks trapped back on the lookout buu is hungry and excited at the prospect of turning more people into food and so he turns everyone on the lookout into chocolate piccolo and gotenks have been attempting to scream loud enough to create an inter-dimensional hole like buu did but they have no success gotenks decides to play his trump card transforming into a super saiyan 3 in this state he has the power necessary to create a hole for him and piccolo to jump through upon their return to the lookout buu tells gotenks that he ate all of his friends and enraged gotenks promises buu that he will pay  
gotenks and super buu begin to fight and the collateral damage from the battle begins to destroy the lookout buu slams gotenks down through the lookout itself down on earth gotenks tries another super ghost kamikaze attack but it once again fails buu lands a powerful hit on gotenks that sends him flying back into the lookout buu then folds himself into a ball and begins repeatedly shooting himself through the lookout until all thats left is rubble floating in the air while still in a ball gotenks is able to trap him in a little sphere he and piccolo then play some volleyball with buu and gotenks spikes him down to earth just when it seems like buu is dead a powerful blast of energy comes from the crater with buu once again ready to fight gotenks only has a few minutes until he separates  
gotenks and buu continue their fight gotenks seems to be wearing buu down and he now has the upper hand in the fight just as hes about to hit buu with his final move gotenks unexpectedly returns straight to his normal state from his super saiyan 3 form the power was too high for him to sustain buu begins beating up gotenks who is now no match for him gohan has finally finished his training and is ready to return to earth after saying goodbye to goku for what they both believe will be the last time kibito takes him back and gohan asks him to change his clothes hes now wearing clothes just like goku he arrives just in time because gotenks has separated  
gohan arrives at the scene and everyone is shocked at how much power he has after gohan expertly pounds him to a pulp buu heals himself and steps up the intensity but gohan still has the upper hand he is easily picking buu apart  
realizing that hes totally outmatched buu decides to self-destruct hoping to take gohan with him gohan escapes before buu explodes and he takes the others with him out of the blast radius afterwards there is no sign of buu but gohan knows that hes still around they suddenly detect dendes energy signal and they go to find him on the way they pick up hercule satan and the dog bee dende explains that as buu was escaping through the inter-dimensional hole mr popo threw him from the lookout because without dende there would be no dragon balls to grant the wishes they intend to use to reverse all the damage buu tracks them down but instead of having a rematch with gohan he calls out goten and trunks  
unknown to the others buu secretly separates two chunks from his back and the two pink blobs creep around behind the others as soon as goten and trunks fuse one of the blobs encases gotenks piccolo too has been covered by a pink blob buu calls each of the blobs back to him which merge with him changing his appearance and giving him access to all of piccolos and gokenks memories abilities and power the new and improved super buu then fights gohan and its clear that buu has the advantage gohan is unable to keep up with buus new speed and strength buu taunts gohan by telling him what his three friends that were absorbed think of him  
gohan is no match for the new super buu buu now possesses new skills such as the super ghost kamikaze attack and the special beam cannon each of which he uses on gohan he is about to finish gohan when bee comes running up hercule tries to save bee but is only several times stronger than the average human - nothing compared to buu buu is about to blast each of them when gohan saves them buu then uses gotenks galactic doughnut trick on gohan and aims a kamehameha wave at him but gohan is able to summon enough strength to break free and move out of the way in time meanwhile in other world king yemma decides to send vegeta back to earth to help in the fight against majin buu on the world of the kais the elder kai decides to give his life to goku so he can return to earth and fight buu the now deceased elder kai gives goku his earrings he explains to goku that if he and another person each wear one they will fuse together  
elder kai tells shin and kibito to try a fusion with their earrings but only after they fuse together does he reveal that it is a permanent fusion dende heals gohans injuries so to prevent this from happening again buu creates a giant energy ball and aims it at dende just before it hits it is deflected by tiens tribeam attack who has decided to help even though he is terribly outclassed buu tries again but goku suddenly appears and sends a disk of energy at the monster it cuts off his legs and part of his head his legs deal tien a crushing kick which completely incapacitates him and then they return to buu desperate to stop majin buu goku throws gohan the other earring but his aim is off and the earring is lost in the rubble goku goes super saiyan 3 in an attempt to hold buu off while gohan searches for the earring inside super buu gotenks fusion wears off splitting back into trunks and goten causing buu to lose well over a third of his power and his appearance to change realising whats happened goku declares he can now defeat majin buu without fusing with gohan and prepares to fight knowing he needs a massive power increase buu causes the part of his head that was cut off earlier to suddenly engulf gohan just like piccolo and gotenks he reabsorbs the blob containing gohan and is now even more powerful than he was with gotenks absorbed  
now back in control buu toys with goku telling him he has some time to find someone to fuse with he considers fusions with dende and hercule but neither of them are appealing possibilities he suddenly senses that vegeta has returned and uses instant transmission to teleport to his location while buu is distracted dende heals tien after goku finds vegeta goku tries to convince him to fuse but vegeta is angry at goku because he knows goku was holding back his super saiyan 3 transformation when they fought with vegeta refusing to cooperate they are forced to take on buu as individuals but are clearly outclassed goku tells vegeta that buu absorbed trunks and killed bulma and asks him to put their differences aside to save their people vegeta finally agrees and only when he puts the earring on does goku mention that the fusion is permanent the two last surviving saiyans fuse and a new being is created  
the new being names himself vegito and begins to fight buu he clearly is far superior to even the new super buu in other world bulma videl chi chi and dabura are looking for gohan whom they mostly believe to be dead when dabura arrived at the check-in station he resisted the guards attempts to subdue his aggressive behaviour and knowing dabura would enjoy being sent to hell king yemma turned him good back on earth dende and hercule arrive at the battle scene just as buu has decided to destroy the earth he creates a massive ball of energy and throws it towards the earth vegito easily catches it and deflects it back out into space buu claims that he has yet to fight at his full power vegito says the same and powers up to a super saiyan  
now calling himself super vegito he continues to thrash majin buu buu tries to hide himself with his own steam to gain the advantage but vegito continues to batter him on the grand kais planet krillin and yamcha are training with king kai back on earth buu is starting to become desperate he liquifies himself and shoots down vegitos mouth entering his body and turning him into what looks like a super-muscular version of himself while inside vegito buu takes control of his body and boasts that he will use him to destroy him from the inside but vegito uses his energy to isolate all of buu into one spot and pound him buu moves around but vegito simply continues to pound him buu is forced to exit vegitos body realising he doesnt know how he can save himself super majin buu begins to freak out and the immense amount of energy he releases into his surroundings threatens to tear apart the universe itself realising this vegito tries to stop him but buu has put up a shield around himself after a long struggle vegito breaks through the shield and stops buu  
vegito and buu continue to fight and vegito is still far more powerful than his opponent he repeatedly dominates buu which makes buu angrier and angrier vegito is just toying with him buu hatches a plan and calls vegito out vegito comes closer and buu turns him into candy meanwhile videl bulma chi chi and dabura continue their search for gohan videl still doesnt believe that gohan is dead  
as buu celebrates his apparent victory the vegito candy unexpectedly begins to attack buu it turns out that vegito is somehow still in full control of his new candy body and that he is just as powerful as he was before and can even still talk albeit in a higher pitch the candy vegito is just as fast as super vegito and due to its tiny size is impossible for buu to hit infuriated at being toyed with by a piece of candy buu changes it back into vegito who then continues to beat him up vegito literally starts tearing buu apart he gives buu until the count of ten until he destroys him and during this countdown buu notices a part of himself that vegito tore off down on the ground this part rises up behind vegito and before vegito reaches ten he is engulfed by the pink blob buu calls the blob back to him and absorbs it  
after absorbing vegito buu notices that he has not taken on any of his characteristics he guesses this is because he hasnt digested vegito yet inside buu vegito still exists intact and separate from buu it turns out that vegito had planned this putting up a barrier during the absorption and letting himself be shrunk by buus magic absorption process but not incorporated into his being once he dispels the barrier vegito unexpectedly splits back into goku and vegeta taking advantage of this unexpected event vegeta crushes his fusion earring not wanting to give up his independence from goku by permanently fusing with him he cites that once they free their absorbed friends buu will lose most of his power and they wont need to be fused to defeat him as they journey through his innards they encounter tiny green pieces of slime the slime starts to attack and it completely covers goku electrocuting and paralysing him suddenly a giant worm appears ready to eat goku  
goku shakes off the slime and blasts the worm injuring it the worms brother then shows up and comically calls for their father but instead of eating goku the father yells at his mischievous sons goku and the daddy worm exchange pleasantries while vegeta feels comically sick due to the worms the worms point them in the right direction but due to the damage goku and vegeta have caused inside buu buu experiences great discomfort and decides to evacuate his bowels buu creates a toilet in the middle of nowhere and comically stinks out the surrounding area including dende and hercule satan goku vegeta and the worms are caught up a surge of liquid rushing through buus innards and the worms declare its potty time a horrified vegeta refuses to be expelled from buus body in such a way he blasts a hole through the wall of whatever fluid tube they are sliding down and flies up through it with goku following after a long journey they finally arrive in buus head where they encounter what appear to be piccolo gohan and gotenks these three begin attacking goku and vegeta and even though goku and vegeta manage to defeat their mysterious attacks they just get back up again and continue fighting it seems goku and vegeta cannot win but when buu goes to a bakery and begins to eat some cake the unstoppable opponents turn into desserts they were just buus thoughts goku and vegeta finally find their four friends who are trapped in cocoons unconscious but alive  
goku and vegeta cut down their four friends and as they do super buu regresses to his normal form dende and hercule continue to follow buu back inside majin buu goku and vegeta also find the fat majin buu they read his thoughts to find out what happened to him suddenly a thought form of super buu himself appears the two join forces to defeat it but once they do another one appears they realize that this is a battle they cannot win buu finally decides that hes had enough and he tries to absorb goku and vegeta  
goku saves vegeta from being absorbed as vegeta recovers goku continues to fight the thought form of super buu goku is rapidly losing energy and just as super buu is about to defeat goku vegeta cuts down the pod containing the fat majin buu this causes super buu to go mad as without the fat majin buu absorbed super buu cannot exist as super buus insides begin to change goku and vegeta realise they must leave and so they grab the pods containing gohan goten piccolo and trunks and try to find a way out on their way through his body they notice one of the tunnels that leads to one of the holes in buus skin where the steam escapes they are able to fly out through here and when they emerge on the other side all six of them regain their normal size as goku and vegeta set the pods down they observe super buu changing into a different being he first transforms into a hulking form and then shrinks into a childlike version of himself  
supreme kai explains to the elder kai that he was once one five supreme kais he was one of the four that each ruled over a quadrant of the universe and the fifth was their leader he says that this latest childlike version kid buu is the original true majin buu and by far the most powerful of them all north and west kai perished against him south kai was absorbed changing the original majin buu into the hulking form that was seen briefly in the previous episode the leader dai kaio was then absorbed by that form but this absorption changed buu into the fat happy buu that came out of the ball this absorption of the kais actually weakened buu making him less focused and less destructive back on earth kid buu creates a powerful ball of energy and throws it at the earth intending to destroy it goku and vegeta deflect it in retaliation kid buu then a creates a ball ten times more powerful than the previous one and throws that knowing that they currently do not have enough strength left to stop it goku and vegeta try to grab everyone and teleport away but are only able to grab dende hercule and bee as the earth is about to be destroyed supreme kai appears and instantly transmits goku vegeta dende hercule and bee to the world of the kais  
buu is blasted apart by the explosion but he reforms after the destruction of the earth and goes on a rampage throughout the galaxy he goes from planet to planet looking for goku and vegeta and then destroys each planet when he doesnt find them he goes to the grand kais planet and starts to toy with everyone there when he becomes bored he creates an energy ball intending to destroy the grand kais planet supreme kai offers goku and vegeta his fusion earrings but they both refuse them they raise their power levels so buu will know where to find them buu abandons his attempt to destroy the grand kais planet and teleports to the world of the kais  
the supreme kai transports himself dende and the elder kai to a distant planet so they will be out of goku and vegetas way along with a crystal ball that allows them to watch the battle unfortunately they forget to take hercule and bee along goku and vegeta play rock paper scissors to decide who will fight first and goku wins he powers up to super saiyan 2 and starts beating up buu he blasts him apart but he reforms buu creates another massive energy ball and throws it down at the planet goku is able to deflect it but buu guides the ball back around and into the planet powerful shockwaves rock the entire planet disfiguring its shape and leaving the surface ragged and uneven goku decides to power up to super saiyan 3  
goku and buu continue to fight each taking powerful blows from each other buu folds himself into a ball again and hits goku hard goku puts all of his energy into a massive kamehameha wave but buu just reforms afterward goku returns to his normal state collapsing from exhaustion vegeta then steps in but finds he is no match for buu buu cleans his clock and just as hes about to deal vegeta the finishing blow goku pushes him out of the way he then powers back up to super saiyan 3 and continues their furious fight vegeta reminisces about all of the fights he and goku were in he finally admits to himself that goku is better  
goku continues to fight buu and he seems to have the upper hand he deals out a lot of damage to buu but as the fight goes on his hits become weaker and weaker until they have virtually no effect at all he tells vegeta that its his turn but vegeta declines citing that he is no match for buu he tells goku that buu is too powerful for him and that goku stands a much better chance of destroying him goku is shocked and unsettled by this admission telling vegeta that he deliberately let the fight drag on so that vegeta could have a turn and now he is exhausted vegeta is horrified by this because now they cannot stop buu goku unsuccessfully attempts to reassure vegeta telling him that he needs one uninterrupted minute to power up enough to destroy buu despite the fact that vegeta recognises that he will need a miracle to survive a minute against buu now he reluctantly steps in while goku is powering up even though goku tells him that if he is destroyed when he is already dead vegeta will no longer exist in any form buu thrashes vegeta but every time he gets knocked down vegeta gets up ready for more buu stretches out his arm wraps it around vegetas neck and begins choking him for fun its been more than one minute but goku hasnt generated the power he needs  
kid buu is about to blast vegeta when suddenly hercule starts to taunt buu buu drops vegeta and turns his attention to hercule the world champ thinking that its all a dream tries to attack buu but is obviously far too weak to do any damage buu is about to destroy hercule but suddenly stops in his tracks clutching his head and screaming while hercule gloats kid buu wrestles with his mind for a while then spits out the fat form of buu who though not part of his physical being was still inside of kid buu shocked and inspired from seeing fat buus still body an enraged hercule tries to beat up kid buu again but fails buu sends a blast toward hercule but it is knocked away by fat buu who has regained consciousness meanwhile goku still cant gather enough energy he starts losing energy and falls to the ground in his normal form  
fat buu is no match for kid buu who begins to severely beat him hercule continues to try to help fat buu but is ineffective vegeta suddenly comes up with a plan he communicates with dende telling him to go to the new planet namek and gather the dragon balls the supreme kai and the elder kai take dende there and the namekians are waiting with the seven balls porunga is summoned and vegeta tells dende his two wishes bring back the earth and restore it to its undamaged state and bring back all of the non-evil people that died since the morning of the world martial arts tournament these wishes are granted and even vegeta himself comes back to life proving that he is no longer evil he finally reveals the main part of his plan to destroy buu the spirit bomb  
the people of earth come back to life including the z fighters and their friends goku gets into position to create the spirit bomb and with the help of king kai vegeta speaks to the entire population of earth he tells them whats going on and that to defeat buu they need to raise their hands up and offer their energy only goku and vegetas family and friends comply no one else is willing to listen to a mysterious voice from the sky vegeta repeatedly pleads with the earthlings but to no avail while this is going on fat buu is buying them time by fighting kid buu but its not going well goku hasnt gathered nearly enough energy to destroy buu  
vegeta continues to plead with the people of earth but no one will listen to him fat buu has finally lost all of his energy so vegeta is forced to fight kid buu he is no match for him and gets severely beaten now goku asks the earthlings to raise up their arms and small pockets of people who recognize his voice or just like the sound of it do so but the vast majority remain uninterested piccolo gohan goten and trunks spread out into the city hoping to convince people to raise their arms hercule has finally had enough and he speaks to the people of earth when they hear the familiar voice of the world champion all of the people of earth raise their arms and offer their energy the spirit bomb is finally ready  
goku is ready to throw the spirit bomb but vegeta is in the way and despite vegetas pleas otherwise he refuses to take out vegeta along with buu suddenly fat buu gets up and holds kid buu down long enough for hercule to pull vegeta to safety kid buu kick fat buu aside and goku throws the spirit bomb it hits kid buu but he starts pushing it back goku uses all of the little energy he has left trying to push it back into kid buu but he is too powerful after a brief panic vegeta suddenly remembers that they still have a third wish with porunga he instructs dende to wish for gokus power level to be restored to its normal healthy level the wish is granted and upon turning into a super saiyan goku is easily able to force the spirit bomb back at majin buu as he does so he silently wishes that buu had been a better person and hopes to fight him some day in the future the spirit bomb hits with full force finally destroying the evil childlike majin buu permanently after billions of years of destruction he has finally been brought to justice  
the supreme kai brings himself dende and the elder kai back to the planet of the kais dende heals vegeta and goku for the final time hercule finds the still body of fat buu and asks dende to heal him so that he wont die vegeta objects and tells hercule to move aside so he can destroy him vegeta says it is too dangerous for any form of majin buu to survive but hercule continues to plead with him goku takes hercules side explaining to vegeta that it was fat buu who saved vegetas life right before goku threw the spirit bomb vegeta reluctantly agrees and the fat majin buu is healed supreme kai takes them all back to dendes lookout where they reunite with friends and family goku tells his family that elder kai gave him his life so he can stay on earth for good as chi-chi breaks down in tears and hugs goku six months later they use their remaining wish with shenron asking him to erase the memory of majin buu from the mind of everyone on earth so that the good buu can assimilate into society life finally returns to normal on earth  
bulma has invited everyone to a barbecue at capsule corporation and gokus family is ready to leave the only problem is that goku is nowhere to be found a frustrated chi chi and the boys leave without him while everyones having a good time at the party goku is out on a mountaintop looking after some eggs that are ready to hatch he protects them from the storm and from predators after they hatch he finally arrives at the party to the delight of everyone  
it is ten years later and much has changed gohan has become a scholar and trunks and goten are in their late teens goku is training with goten when bulma and vegeta who have a new daughter bulla show up after not seeing him in five years goku says that he and goten will be entering the world martial arts tournament so vegeta says that he and trunks will do the same the day of the tournament comes and old friends catch up everyone has arrived to watch gohan who is now married to videl has decided not to enter but his daughter pan will fight since there is no junior division this time she will be fighting with the adults hercule and buu will also be fighting however goku says that there is someone who is 100% human that can threaten to beat him and vegeta  
the seeding draw for the tournament begins and goku asks majin buu to use his magic to rig it so that he faces the powerful mystery fighter he had talked about in the first match pan faces wild tiger and the four-year-old easily dispatches him next up is goku against a ten-year-old boy named uub uub is the reincarnation of the evil kid majin buu king yemma apparently heard gokus wish right before the evil buu was destroyed and he reincarnated him as a good person named uub uub is apprehensive so to bait him into fighting goku eventually resorts to taunting the young boy after a particularly nasty insult and a kick to the face uub has snapped and is now ready to fight  
goku and uub begin to fight and its clear that uub doesnt know much about fighting but as the match goes on he learns more and more and more and more of his hidden power is released until he is able to go toe to toe with goku in his base state without goku powering up when goku does power up slightly in his normal state uub nearly falls out of the ring but goku saves him from hitting the ground he realizes that uub doesnt even know how to fly so goku decides to train him despite his friends and family pleading with goku to stay he flies away with uub on his back goku decides to train uub to defend the earth when hes gone he hopes one day when uubs training is complete to have a real all-out match with him to test their power at the tournament many battles rage on goten fights the fat majin buu and trunks is up against a strange man who clearly makes trunks very uncomfortable with his behaviour many of the z-fighters participating in the tournament win their fights as well even four-year-old pan goku and uub fly off into the distance with whoops of joy

sanosuke and anji continue their duel anji is reborn to salvation after talking about his past and being convinced by sanosuke and the memories from the people of his past that he was doing the wrong thing all these years by being a destroyer kenshin and saito continue on ahead to fight usui uonuma the second challenger of the jupongottana  
usui confronts saito while the others continue on through shishios manshion usuis claim to his hearts eye is put to the test by saito who observes that it is simply super enhanced hearing adopted by usui to make up for his lack of sight saito realizes that usui is in fact weak since his desire for revenge against shishio has driven him to become a mere pawn in shishios game an enraged usui wounds saito using the timbe a tortoise-shell shield and blocks his vision however usui is no match for saitos zeroshiki attack a move saito had been saving for a fight against kenshin  
kenshin senses something coming from the room of hōji sadojima that being the presence of aoshi he enters the room and is determined to keep his promise to aoshi and to misao by fighting and bringing back aoshi to the inn upon entering the room aoshi greets him and he says that he has thrown everything away including his four comrades just for the moment of the duel with him and kenshin aoshi is determined to win the fight and kill the manslayer to claim the title of the strongest  
as the duel between kenshin and aoshi continues kenshin is being attacked by aoshi trying to scold him for who he ought to be kenshin is determined to return aoshi to an affectionate man allowing him to bring aoshi back misao thus attempting keep both promises he made to each of them aoshi finally realizes his wrongdoings as kenshin and aoishi ends the match using their final attacks on each other after emerging victorious kenshin and sanosuke advance to the next battle  
kaoru yahiko and misao are to battle against kamatari honjō henya kariwa and iwanbō yahiko manages to defeat henya after being almost killed by his hikku happa attack after that kamatari kaoru and misao fight misao gets crushed ribs in the fight against kamatari and is unable to continue until she wakes up from a dream of hannya and she and kaoru defeat kamatari through a combined effort it seems like they have won until two other members of the ten swords elder saizuchi and fuji appear which in turn puts kaoru yahiko and misao at a major disadvantage  
just when all hope seems lost seijuro shows up and fights fuji he talks to fuji and make him realize that he was being used and asks for a fair fight he defeats fuji with the kuzu-ryūsen attack the inn is safe from harm but kenshin still has to fight sojiro in order to fight shishio himself  
kenshin and sojiro have their second duel since the one in shingetsu village was never finished sojiro shows kenshin his shukuchi technique one that uses powerful legwork to bring him close to his opponent in an instant kenshin manages to get himself pretty wounded in the fight and sojiro hasnt even gotten hit once he even dodges the kuzu-ryūsen attack ironically supposed to be an inescapable attack sojiro recalls about kenshin showing mercy to senkaku during their battle at shingetsu village which poses as a distraction to sojiro this then urges sojiro to take an intermission from the battle after breaking the strap of one of his shoes  
it is shown that sojiro was treated as a servant to his family one that never showed him respect or affection he later meets shishio who kindly spared his life after learning how cruel sojiros family is to him shishio offers him the wakizashi sword when sojiro is soon cornered by his family he uses the sword to murder them all sojiro follows shishio as shishio tells sojiro that he will become strong  
after pondering between the philosophies of shishios survival of the strong and kenshins protection of the weak sojiro becomes heavily confused suddenly breaking down during the fight sojiro and kenshin fight each other and full strength the shuntensatsu attack versus the amakakeru ryū no hirameki attack after kenshin is claimed the winner he and sanosuke make their way to the final battle with shishio sojiro tells yumi of a secret passageway to get to shishios room first he also reveals the secret of kenshins ultimate attack in that kenshin takes an extra step in his stance sojiro then requests yumi to return the wakizashi sword back to shishio as a parting gift to leave his side forever  
yumi guides kenshin and sanosuke to the top of the inferno arena kenshin thinks about his past and what awaits him next the entire way up to where shishio himself is waiting with hōji at his side shishio promises that the battle will end in fifteen minutes giving yumi a kiss as he walks off thus the fight between the two manslayers begins shishio shows off the homura dama attack the first of his secret sword technique he then bites a chunk off of kenshins shoulder  
shishio doesnt believe that kenshin understands the laws of nature philosophizes about the survival of the fittest through chaos and not just a worthless mirage of peace shishio then uses the guren kaina attack the second of his secret sword technique giving kenshin a concussion saito suddenly busts through the door using his gatotsu first stance executing the ishiki attack however shishio is protected by a metal plate in his forehead after trying the rest of his gatotsu stances saito soon gets knocked out by shishio even sanosuke attempts to attack shishio but to no avail it is then that aoshi appears to engage in combat with shishio  
aoshi struggles to defeat shishio even after landing the kaiten kenbu rokuren attack after much time passes by kenshin regains consciousness due to his swordsman spirit surviving the painful injuries inflicted by shishio just when shishio is about to finish kenshin off with another guren kaina attack kenshin remembers the promise he made to kaoru to go back to tokyo together kenshin is able to initiate the kuzu-ryūsen attack of the hiten mitsurugi-ryū injuring shishio nonetheless shishio gets back up because of his swordsman spirit despite his injuries and fatigue kenshin prepares his final attack the battōjutsu amakakeru ryū no hirameki  
shishio gets ready to use the kaguzuchi attack the final of his secret sword technique to counter kenshins move this result in a void between the two attacks which temporarily immobilized shishio enabling kenshin to strike shishio with an immensely strong consecutive hit even after miraculously standing back up shishios blood starts evaporating and he begins screaming in pain since he has fought far longer than fifteen minutes however shishio sets his sights on kenshin and yumi impaling them both even after yumi tries to stop kenshin from killing shishio yumi dies happily knowing she did something useful for once as the battle continues the battle is once again at a standstill however shishio is killed by spontaneous combustion hōji refusing to accept shishios defeat maniacally attempts to destroy the inferno arena to kill kenshin sanosuke saito and aoshi  
sanosuke and aoshi drag kenshin out of the building eventually escaping the eruption saito is left behind due to his overly injured legs not being able to jump the collapsed bridge the inferno arena finally demolishes seemingly killing saito kenshin sanosuke and aoshi regroup with kaoru yahiko and misao chō also appears to tell the group the aftermath of the ten swords meanwhile shishio yumi and hōji gather in the underworld and plot an ambush  
yahiko visits mount hiei and sanosuke shows him where that battle with shishio took place meanwhile kenshin visits an unknown womans grave and places flowers by it also at this time megumi explains to kaoru the severity of kenshins wounds and that it is important to keep him from doing anything that dangerous again finally the group gets on the train to tokyo with misao waving to them and telling them to visit again after the train departs saito is seen saying that he and kenshin will meet again one day and settle the score that they have when the gang reaches the road to the dojo kaoru extends her hand and welcomes kenshin home

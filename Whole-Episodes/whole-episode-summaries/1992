it looks like the heart virus trunks warned about came true after all but at a bad time for goku as he is in the clutches of android 19 suddenly vegeta saves goku and prepares to fight the androids and hes got a surprise for everyone¬† 
finally becoming a super saiyan vegeta easily defeats android 19 but 20 has escaped to come up with a new plan vegeta and the others look for the diabolical android but it wont be easy¬† 
android 20 grabs piccolo from behind in order to steal his energy so he can defeat the z fighters but gohan comes to piccolos rescue just in time after eating a senzu bean to restore the energy android 20 stole piccolo begins to fight with the android meanwhile trunks has returned to the past and has discovered something different about these androids- hes never seen them before so where are the androids he warned goku about¬† 
bulma arrives on the scene to discover that android 20 is dr gero himself the insane scientist fires an energy blast as a smokescreen so he can escape to activate androids 17 and 18 which sends bulma flying after saving his young mother and younger self trunks follows vegeta to stop him from facing the androids head-on as the others try to find geros laboratory before he does but will they make it¬† 
dr gero hides on the ground as the z warriors are close to finding his secret laboratory thanks to bulma but the mad doctor wont give up so easily meanwhile gokus condition is starting to get better but will he recover quickly enough to help his friends¬† 
androids 17 and 18 the ones responsible for the future destruction of earth have finally awakened it seems the androids will not follow dr geros orders as they try to activate another android - 16 can the creator control his creations¬† 
after destroying dr gero the androids head to gokus place to complete their mission but vegeta arrives to face them head-on the first to fight is the beautiful android 18 is vegetas super saiyan strength enough to defeat the android¬† 
vegeta fights with everything hes got but he cant beat android 18 to save his father trunks steps in to help but gets beaten easily by 17 as do piccolo and tien as 16 just stands there 17 and 18 have easily beat earths heroes and head off to complete their mission but can goku recover in time to help and protect himself¬† 
as the androids try to find a car for some fun the z-fighters try to think of a way to get stronger quickly as piccolo heads to kamis lookout for the one thing he needs to beat the androids- fuse with kami¬† 
the androids find a car to find goku but have to deal with the authorities meanwhile kami looks over the earth for some time to decide to fuse with piccolo as krillin and trunks head to gokus house to take him somewhere else but how long can goku be hidden until hes better¬† 
the androids are still driving a van to gokus house goku is being taken to another place to be safe from androids he is ill and sees nightmares bulma gets news about a time machine made by capsule corp where has it come from and who does it belong to¬† 


 japan 
gohan and trunks head to the other time capsule with bulma to find out more about the truth of the extra time machine¬† 
while gohan and trunks go to master roshis island theres a crisis in gingertown where its inhabitants are disappearing but with no damage to the town realizing this threat kami decides to fuse with piccolo but will their combined power be enough to handle whatever is going on down there¬† 
the deserted streets of gingertown become a battlefield as the powered-up piccolo confronts this terror from the future the monsters name is cell and he gains strength from sucking the power out of his victims but thats not the only secret the creature reveals somehow he also knows gokus special move the kamehameha¬† 
with the element of surprise the creature gets a hold of piccolo and begins to absorb him but piccolo manages to break free with his arm weakened piccolo surrenders but the super namekian asks for one last request to know who this creature is his name is cell an android made of the strongest fighters in the universe and hes hungry for more power thanks to dr gero¬† 
as the android from the future tells piccolo his objective to absorb androids 17 and 18 to obtain his perfect form piccolo regenerates his arm with his power restored and krillin and trunks by his side piccolo has a good chance against cell but the android has more tricks up his sleeve it is revealed that cell killed trunks in his future¬† 
by using tiens solar flare cell manages to escape and suppress his power in order to complete his dreadful mission after telling everyone the bad news piccolo and tien find cell as trunks and krillin try to find the bunker beneath geros laboratory and destroy the present cell and find some incredible news the plans of android 17¬† 
as krillin heads back to master roshis he crosses cells path and barely escapes his wrath as piccolo and tien arrive at the scene meanwhile trunks finds his father to train with him in order to surpass a super saiyan as hope seems lost a glimmer still remains goku has made a recovery and plans to get stronger but how¬† 
after enduring the terrifically horrifying effect of the viral heart disease goku recovers and has only one objective on his mind surpassing the level of super saiyan with vegetas mind set on reaching the same seemingly unreachable goal goku takes him trunks and gohan to the mysterious hyperbolic time chamber a room where one year is equivalent to that of one earth day meanwhile the androids face an unexpected and unforeseen issue gokus not home with the androids now closing in on master roshis island can piccolo beat the destructive trio¬† 
piccolo begins his epic battle against android 17 and he seems to be on par with the mechanical monster meanwhile bulma continues to work on the remote that will shut down the androids however cell can feel piccolos energy and knowing he must be fighting one of the androids he charges towards them in the hope that he will become complete¬† 
piccolo and 17 continue their showdown unaware that the power-hungry cell is approaching fast piccolo is as strong as 17 but fatigue kicks in while the malicious androids power remains undrained meanwhile goku and gohan impatiently wait for vegeta and trunks to finish their super saiyan training in the hyperbolic time chamber cell arrives at the battlefield ready to attain his final perfect form and the androids dont seem to know who cell is¬† 
with more people absorbed cell has become more powerful than both piccolo and 17 combined despite piccolos best attempts cell easily disposes of piccolo knowing of his origin and mission the androids must work together in order to save themselves from cells overwhelming power¬† 
with piccolo gone android 17 has no choice but to fight cell on his own or so it seems that is until android 16 steps in to fight as the battle rages on it is easily noticeable that android 16 is just as strong as cell but can the silent giant android 16 defeat cell or maybe this fight will buy vegeta and trunks the precious time they need to complete their training in the hyperbolic time chamber¬† 
the battle between android 16 and cell continues cell tries to counter-attack but falls short to 16s inferno flash 16 warns 17 and 18 to quickly leave the battlefield however they wait believing cell to be dead but before they can do so cell sneaks up behind 17 and before he can get awaycell quickly absorbs him cell transforms into his second imperfect form and his next task is to absorb 18 to become complete android 16 attempts to attack cell but is no match for his second form and is severely damaged by a blast from cell tien then attempts to give 16 and 18 time to escape by using several attacks to stall cell¬† 
tien attempting to give 16 and 18 enough time to escape subsequently uses up all his energy in a vicious attack and falls to the ground goku knows that cell is far stronger than tien so he descends on the battlefield to help tien recover while there he notices piccolo is still alive but hes hanging on by a thread cell desires to fight goku immediately but goku uses his instant transmission to get back to kamis lookout successfully and vegeta and trunks finally emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber¬† 
goku asks trunks about the training but vegeta doesnt want him to say anything about it meanwhile 18 questions 16 on his love for nature and asks if he even cares that cell might absorb her and kill him bulma lands at kamis lookout she gives gohan goku trunks and vegeta a set of saiyan armours tien and piccolo refuse to wear the suits claiming they do not want to wear the same clothes as the saiyans vegeta then leaves to find and destroy cell while trunks closely follows anxious to find 18 cell finds a chain of inhabited islands and insisted to obliterate each island with energy blasts bringing him closer to the androids hideout back at kamis lookout after eating a quick amount of food goku and gohan enter the hyperbolic time chamber to start training¬† 
the heartless cell continues to destroy the islands he eventually finds the last island where androids 16 and 18 is hiding and threatens to destroy it together with them vegeta anxious to test his new power heads towards cells whereabouts and transforms to super saiyan just as cell is about to destroy the last island vegeta arrives to fight cell up on kamis lookout tien and piccolo dont believe that vegeta has the power to beat cell and neither does android 18 based on the fact that she beat vegeta in their fight as vegeta begins to power up he begins his transformation which stuns everybody that senses his power including 18 and cell vegeta finishes transforming reaching an ascended level of super saiyan and begins the fight by delivering the first hit to cell¬† 
as vegeta battles cell it is clear that vegeta has the upper hand in the fight his strength superior to cells watching from the sidelines trunks recalls the intense time he spent training with his father in the hyperbolic time chamber as the fight between cell and vegeta continues the pressure falls on gohan as he trains in the time chamber with goku in an attempt to become a super saiyan¬† 
goku and gohan continue to push themselves forward in their training but at this point they may not even be needed in his powered up state vegeta is making quick work of cell who seems to be utterly no match for vegeta vegeta then explains to cell that it is useless to fight him in his current state as even if he somehow manages to get past him trunks would finish him off with his back against the wall the ever-clever android attempts to exploit vegetas weakest point his unbridled arrogance but vegeta brushes this off as an attempt from cell to get his own way at which cell becomes infuriated¬† 
with cell being thrown around by vegeta cell still attempts to exploit vegetas weak point in an attempt to get the chance to absorb android 18 with 18 in his sights krillin attempts to get closer to her in an attempt to shut down the android forever but at the moment of decision krillin hesitates his emotions clouding his judgement cell is gaining momentum in his push for perfection enticing vegeta to be able to test his true power upon hearing this android 16 tells 18 that she must leave immediately as vegeta may let cell go krillins emotions finally get the best of him and he destroys the controller in front of 18 just as vegeta lets cell go and find 18 trunks fearful of what would happen intervenes and prevents cell from looking for 18 just as cell complains to vegeta he catches a glimpse of 18 on the ground and can only gape at the android¬† 
cell has spotted 18 but so has trunks and he warns krillin 16 and 18 that cell knows their whereabouts just as cell begins flying towards them trunks gives chase and every time cell gets the chance to absorb 18 trunks intervenes vegeta has other plans however and begins to interfere with trunks trunks defies vegetas thought that trunks is too weak-minded to attack his own father and sends vegeta flying towards the water with a large ki blast as trunks continues to interfere with cells quest the android sees 16 and 18 getting away and devises a plan using tiens solar flare technique to blind everybody including vegeta as he heads back to the battlefield with nobody but krillin to stand in his way cell is unfazed by krillins attempts to stall cell as he absorbs 18 and begins his transformation¬† 
dr geros dream has been realized as cell begins his final transformation with everybody but vegeta who has realized his own dream of testing his strength looking on in fear after cell becomes complete he begins testing his new body as krillin and trunks attempt to subdue him eventually cell tests one of his kicks on krillin knocking him out cold up in the hyperbolic time chamber gohan and goku are still training gohan becomes tired of being treated like his fathers son and wants goku to give it everything hes got goku complies transforms to a super saiyan and unleashes a powerful kamehameha wave at gohan who while fighting it realizes how he has let people down his whole life and finally transforms into a super saiyan albeit maintaining the transformation only for a couple minutes¬† 
after allowing cell to reach his final form vegeta is ready for the challenge he was promised while cell has become a brick wall to the saiyans every blow it becomes clear that vegeta has bitten off more than he can chew as even a direct blow to the android barely phases him meanwhile goku and gohan who is now a proper super saiyan continue to train in the hyperbolic time chamber¬† 
vegeta is clearly no match for cell now he has powered up to his perfect form and it seems trunks will have no choice but to reveal his hidden ascended power just as it appears that vegeta is losing consciousness however he powers up for his ultimate move the final flash he spends several minutes powering up for the attack crumbling the surrounding landscape as he does so as he prepares to launch it he challenges cell to stay right where he is and take on his attack he launches it and it proves very effective demolishing cells right arm and a large portion of the right side of his torso vegeta begins laughing but his celebration is quickly cut short when cell reminds vegeta that he possesses piccolos regenerative ability cell resumes the fight and after a massive onslaught of ki blasts from vegeta knocks vegeta out cold and prepares to kill vegeta until he senses that trunks is beginning to power up¬† 
with vegeta out of commission its up to the newly-ascended trunks to take down cell as they fight trunks tries to divert cells attention away from his unconscious fathers body allowing krillin to bring him to safety meanwhile goku and gohan continue training in the hyperbolic time chamber¬† 
trunks recounts the events that lead to the destruction of the z fighters in the future using the rage from these memories trunks powers up to finish his battle with cell cell then tells trunks how he was created and why he traveled to the future as the battle continues trunks has the upper hand but cell claims that he knows trunks cannot beat him¬† 
as the battle between trunks and cell rages on cell reveals trunkss weakness in his ascended form his new bulk slows him down goku having ascended in the hyperbolic time chamber also realizes this he plans to spend as much time as possible as a super saiyan to eliminate this weakness vegeta recovers and returns to the island to resume his battle with cell with krillin in tow upon their arriving however trunks informs them that cell refuses to defeat him but rather plans to revive the world martial arts tournament for a real challenge he wants to fight anyone on earth who thinks they have the strength to defeat him once and for all before he destroys it¬† 


 japan 
trunks tells the others about cells tournament it will be held in nine days which doesnt give them much time to prepare cell builds the tournament ring and begins to get the word out about the cell games¬† 
as goku and gohan continue to train in the hyperbolic time chamber yamcha and krillin begin to get ready for the cell games cell goes on television and announces his plan to the world he challenges earths best fighters to beat him¬† 
goku and gohan finally emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber and trunks gets them up to speed on whats happening they decide that in the nine remaining days until the cell games piccolo will go in the chamber first followed by vegeta and finally trunks goku decides that he and gohan dont need another period of training in the chamber and will finish their training outside goku confronts cell to size him up¬† 
goku asks korin to weigh his strength against cells and the verdict is that cell is still stronger than goku however goku doesnt seem worried by this at all he seems to have a secret plan meanwhile cell begins to warm up for the tournament by flying into space and destroying some meteors goku sets out he and gohans training regimen which is three days of rest three days of training and then three more days of rest¬† 
as goku continues to relax gohan goes into town and befriends a young girl named lime while there he discovers that the villagers are panicked about cell and have built a shelter mr bourbon the rich man who owns the shelter hired general tao to force the villagers to do what he says gohan is forced to step in and take him on¬† 
chi chi reminisces about the story of how gohan was named goku gohan and krillin relax by picking apples goku remembers an incident involving the tree and a baby gohan later they celebrate gohans birthday¬† 
piccolo emerges from the hyperbolic time chamber as a much more powerful warrior and vegeta takes his place inside to begin his training as cell awaits the start of the games the royal military shows up to try and stop him of course their attempts are futile and cell smites the entire force goku wanting to bring all of these innocent people back to life decides to locate the remaining nameks and ask one of them to become the new guardian of earth¬† 
goku travels to the nameks new planet and dende decides to become the new guardian mr satan announces that he will be fighting against cell in the tournament once dende arrives on earth he creates a new dragon and a new set of dragon balls this new dragon will be able to grant two wishes at a time goku then begins to gather up the seven balls¬† 
with the cell games right around the corner mr satan is busy attending rallies in his own support meanwhile goku is tracking down the last two dragon balls he finds that general tao is in possession of them rather than risk a fight that he knows hell lose tao challenges goku to unlock three puzzle rings to earn his dragon balls finally goku gathers all seven dragon balls and just in time because the cell games are ready to start¬† 
the cell games have finally begun and all of the earths fighters have come to take on the evil tyrant cell mr satan shows up first convinced that he will be the one to take down cell¬† 
mr satans students show up and decide to fight cell first each of them is defeated with virtually no effort from cell mr satan then steps in and is defeated in a more forceful manner with cell pushing mr satan aside into the mountainside finally goku steps into the ring to fight cell¬† 
the fight between cell and goku begins and the earth begins to shake as they fight after they finally land back on the ring it is revealed that it was just their warm-up goku prepares to power up to full strength as the real battle is about to begin¬† 
with goku and cell fully powered up the battle begins and as the match progresses cell realizes that they are very evenly matched and so he resorts to trickery first he uses tiens multi-form trick then he tries piccolos special beam cannon and friezas final attack frustrated he fires an incredibly powerful kamehameha wave luckily goku is able to direct it away from the planet and teleport back to the ring¬† 
the battle between goku and cell continues to heat up both of them seem to have even strength and speed after goku nearly falls out of the ring cell decides to destroy the ring and continue the fight with no rules with nothing restricting them the battle quickly intensifies and as they fight their power seems to increase as they fight on goku decides to attempt to trick cell by preparing a kamehameha wave from up in the air cell doesnt believe that goku would risk destroying the earth and so does nothing to defend himself as the other fighters look on in horror believing that goku will release it from the air goku uses his instant transmission technique and appears directly beneath cell he unleashes the wave directly into cells chest and when the dust clears cell is severely maimed it appears that goku has won the tournament¬† 
as the dust clears cells mangled body becomes visible while the rest of the z fighters believe that theyve won goku thinks differently he senses that something isnt right when he can still feel a large amount of energy in whats left of cells body suddenly cells body stands up to the horror of virtually everybody and regenerates the missing parts cells energy has been depleted by the attack but gokus energy has been depleted more severely and as the battle continues it becomes clear that goku is no match for cell knowing that he cannot win he declares that cell is the winner the z fighters and cell cant believe it¬† 
after gokus shocking declaration cell claims victory over earth but goku says that cell has one more competitor to fight cell has already fought and defeated vegeta trunks and piccolo and these three are supposed to be the strongest of the remaining fighters goku stuns everyone by selecting gohan he claims that gohans strength far exceeds his own despite the rest of the z fighters protests and even despite the fact that goku willingly gives cell one of their senzu beans goku remains confident in gohans strength gohan then powers up and begins his battle with cell¬† 
it appears that cell has delivered the final blow to gohan but gohan is able to recover and he looks more powerful than ever he warns cell that if he is pushed an unbelievable power will be unleashed he tells him about the time raditz came to earth and he was forced to let loose his amazing strength to save goku he also tells cell about the time he had to do the same thing to save krillin from frieza instead of being scared by this cell is intrigued and is determined to push gohan to his limit so he can test himself against this awesome strength¬† 
cell begins to punish gohan in every way he can think of in order to unleash his hidden power he inflicts as much pain as he can on the young saiyan warrior as cell is trying to crush gohan android 16 jumps in and grabs cell he attempts to use the self-destruct explosive inside his chest but finds that he cant krillin reveals that bulma removed it while repairing him cell destroys 16 with one blast and then turns his attention on gohans friends his tail opens up and seven tiny cell juniors pop out one for each of the z fighters¬† 
the cell juniors are attacking the z fighters and theres nothing they can do to defend themselves only trunks and vegeta are able to remotely put up a fight as they continue to beat up on them android 16s head rolls towards the camera crew and makes his final wish he asks mr satan to bring him to gohan running through the crossfire caused by piccolos rapid fire technique he throws 16s head towards gohan once there 16 tells gohan that it is okay to fight if youre doing it for the right reasons and to unleash his power after he utters his final words he is crushed by cell this is enough to push gohan over the edge and to transform into a super saiyan 2¬† 
gohan angered by the destruction of android 16 begins to ascend to a super saiyan 2 cell initially thinks that gohan is making the same mistake that trunks did by simply powering up eventually though gohan fully transforms into a super saiyan 2 to the amazement of the z fighters gohan is fully powered up now to the delight of cell until gohan snatches the bag of senzu beans from cell before he realizes it with the beans in hand he begins to attack the cell juniors one by one he destroys each of the cell juniors each with a single blow trunks comments that he did the transformation right increasing his strength without losing speed when gohan is finished destroying the cell juniors he gives the senzu beans to trunks to distribute to the wounded z fighters and moves on to cell himself¬† 
cell and gohan begin to fight and from the start it is clear that gohan is far superior to cell none of cells punches are landing and gohan doesnt even appear to be trying piccolo comments that the reason goku fought cell first was to show gohan how cell fights cell decides that he should fight at full strength as he powers up the earth itself shakes but even at full power and delivering a quick blow to gohan gohan is able to easily deliver two crushing blows to cell severely damaging cell it appears that gohan has won although piccolo comments that its not over yet¬† 
gohan no matter how many attacks cell throws at him is totally unfazed by cells attacks and it looks more and more like gohan will win the battle desperate cell aims a massive kamehameha wave at the earth hoping to destroy it gohan counters this with an even bigger wave which hits cell and dismembers him gohan starts to reveal the sadistic qualities of the super saiyan 2 preferring to let cell suffer despite gokus protests that gohan must destroy cell now cell regenerates himself and becomes enraged and powers up to an extreme power level but makes the same mistake that trunks did and is unable to hit gohan due to his size gohan then delivers several crushing blows to cell including a kick to his gut which eventually causes cell to regurgitate android 18¬† 
with android 18 no longer a part of cell he regresses to his second imperfect form and finds himself absolutely no match for gohan goku pleads with gohan to end the battle immediately but gohans new found arrogance causes him to simply toy with cell in desperation cell decides to blow himself up along with the planet but goku makes the ultimate sacrifice he transports cell to king kais planet and they are destroyed in the blast goku has managed to save the earth from certain doomat the cost of his own life as the z fighters are mourning the loss of their friend and gohan angered that his arrogance caused him to lose his father cell suddenly reappears and critically wounds trunks with a single blast¬† 
cell is once again in his perfect form after regenerating from his own explosion he reveals that one single cell was left after the explosion and that was enough for him to come back vegeta becomes enraged at the loss of his son and attempts to take on cell on his own he unleashes a barrage of blasts at cell but is eventually tossed aside easily by the even more powerful cell cell aims a blast at vegeta attempting to finish him off but gohan dives in front of him and takes the blast himself gohan survives but is severely injured losing the use of his left arm and whats more krillin has no senzu beans left cell then begins to charge up a kamehameha blast to destroy the earth and proclaims that he will live forever¬† 
cell is through playing games so he decides to take out gohan and the earth once and for all while powering up his kamehameha wave he explains how he became dr geros ultimate perfection gohan thinks this is the end of the world but suddenly goku begins to speak to him telepathically through king kai he tells gohan that he has the strength and that he cannot give up so despite only being able to use one arm gohan powers up the biggest kamehameha wave he can maneuver and aims it directly at cell just as cell releases his wave¬† 
gohan and cells waves collide creating a crater in the earth as gohan struggles to put all of his energy into his wave cells wave begins to overtake his despite the telepathic encouragement of goku seeing that gohan is losing piccolo comes to his aid and attacks cell although the attack is deflected with no effort from cell he continues his efforts tien yamcha and krillin all join in but it is all for nought just as it looks like cell is going to win vegeta fires a giant beam directly at cell and this distraction is just enough for gohan to make the final push and defeat cell the perfect android disintegrates into nothingness thanks to gohans kamehameha wave and the battle was won¬† 
with cell defeated the z fighters head to the lookout to summon the dragon this dragon is able to grant two wishes but unfortunately goku cant be wished back because hes already been brought back in the afterlife although they think of a way to revive him goku suddenly speaks to all of them through king kai he says that all of the trouble that has been caused on earth is because of him frieza the androids and cell were all after him he seems to be a magnet for trouble so he decides to remain in the other world for the earth to be safe without goku now they have one more wish left¬† 
because no one can think of a good wish krillin decides to use it to turn android 18 into a human however shenron says it is beyond his power to do that then krillin wishes to take the explosives out of her which shenron accepts after trunks goes back to his own time life returns to normal for the rest of the z fighters as gohan tells chi-chi that goku will not come back this time and chi-chi begins crying about her loss¬† 
back in his own time trunks decides it is time to end the fight once and for all he finds androids 17 and 18 and easily defeats them later the imperfect cell tries to sneak up on trunks but trunks is too quick for him trunks being much more powerful than cell quickly dispatches him the nightmare is finally over meanwhile goku and king kai begin their journey to the otherworld¬†

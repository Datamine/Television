jack is forced to interrogate audrey when he learns that she might be connected to bierko and the terrorists although he is convinced of her innocence karen hayes is unconvinced and decides to push audrey harder forcing jack and chloe to search for evidence that stenger is lying eventually stenger admits that implicating audrey was a ploy to throw ctu off and informs them of bierkos next target wayne and pierce manage to link up and flee from armed men who have orders from henderson to kill them bierko and his men execute the next phase of attacks by targeting a gas company and releasing the sentox gas throughout los angeles jack and curtis lead a tac team to stop bierko but are too late to prevent the sentox being released jack then sets c4 charges on the main gas pipe to destroy the gas before it can reach the main gas tank jack captures bierko just as he is trying to escape

he also disturbs bees causing them to swarm around him he shows up at the aqua teens house wanting to use the insane-o-flex frylock tells him how about taking that broom out of your ass first to which carl tells him that he likes the broom there frylock struggles to put the motherboard into the insane-o-flex but it wont fit as its a completely different font carl pretends to help him but steals the motherboard instead

carl creates his own genetically engineered dog he names it the enforcer” though it prefers the name spaghetti” he orders spaghetti to rape handbanana but spaghetti does not find himself attracted to handbanana and instead brutally gang rapes carl along with handbanana it turns out later in the episode that the software make your own dog 10 is illegal in most nations and has adverse side-effects such as the dog forming a mental link with members of the owners family in this case it is carl which is why only he can hear handbananas threats  
the episode ends with master shake and frylock looking out the window and watching spaghetti and handbanana brutally make love to carl frylock goes to lock the doors and leaves master shake alone master shake then begins to move up and down giving the illusion that he is masturbating frylocks voice can be heard saying no one wants to see that shake go to your room to which master shake replies i dont have a room 
 
master shake attempts to learn electric guitar from a video tutorial but is easily outdone by meatwad who plays a metal riff flawlessly meatwad points out that shakes small hands make it hard for him to play so shake deliberately agitates a beehive in order to swell his hands 
meanwhile frylock is working on creating a time machine but shake and meatwad seem more concerned about a protrusion on his face frylock sees a doctor thinking it to just be a simple skin irritation but after testing the doctor reveals that frylock has cancer as the episode goes on frylock appears more and more sick and has fewer and fewer fries shake meatwad and carl try to cheer him up by throwing him a party with andrew wk performing but frylock just wants to rest 
the three are very concerned and shake comes up with an idea involving the time machine he proceeds to destroy it and burn it hoping the fumes will smoke the cancer out but burns down the house frylock tells them he cannot be out in the sun so he goes to live with carl temporarily who is concerned about whether he can get his disease or not shake straps himself to a rocket hoping to blow up the sun for frylock but the rocket explodes killing him 
later frylock returns to the doctor for further test results and he discovers the latest tests were negative the doctor however claims that aliens have landed and that they must band together to stop them just as they arrive and start destroying the office this all turns out to be a dream of frylocks and he awakes at the doctors who tells him the tests were negative and he should be fine 
 
meatwad and master shake call frylock late at night having been thrown in jail for a dui while driving carls car the next morning carl discovers his car missing finds a post-it note on the curb saying thanks for car ms” and tries to peddle shoddy giants uniforms he commissioned to be made to frylock later in carls room bart oates appears much to carls excitement carl recounts his stats and the many games of oates he watched then reveals how he had hoped oates would become injured after he transferred to the 49ers oates reveals that it was because of this that he had to get knee surgery and retire bart reappears several more times giving carl advice on how to be a better person and improve his life he tutors him on being polite to frylock convinces him to bail shake and meatwad out of jail and forces him to apologize to the grave of an elderly man he ran over and to the band chicago who he swindled by selling counterfeit chicago shirts they werent even good counterfeits as they said chicano instead of chicago oates finally leads carl to linda hamiltons house and instructs carl to kill her so she wont give birth to john connor who will lead the resistance to the rise of the machines bart claims hes been sent by them and reveals how when he got his surgery he was implanted with computers bart rips apart his skin revealing his insides and carl notes that most of his interior work is just old garbage a discovery that dismays bart oates alarms go off at the house and carl flees 
sometime later frylock picks a bb pellet out of carls brain wondering how it got there in a flashback we see that bart oates convinced shake to shoot carl from outside his house 
 
as the show begins master shake is spitting mucus into a kiddie pool so that meatwad can make a sculpture out of it which he affectionately names mucus man frylock yells at them but rather than trying to get them to stop their slimy activity he convinces the pair they need to heat up the mucus on a grill in order to be able to mold it correctly he tries to set them up with a harmless environmentally friendly grill made of wood but master shake instead buys the char-nobyl 6000 an illegally imported barbecue grill with a nuclear core made of radioactive waste from chernobyl shake forgets to turn off the grill which sets clouds on fire disintegrates the ozone layer melts the polar ice caps and floods new jersey suddenly mucus man who has been brought to life by the radioactivity appears and asks who owns the grill frylock points the fry at shake who in turn blames meatwad mucus man thanks meatwad for creating the perfect environment for him to survive -- and take over your dumbass planet 
twelve years later the mucus creatures have enslaved the world they constantly whip frylock shake and carl into spitting up phlegm meatwad rules as their ruthless king even having carl congested executed by his mucus minions however at this point we are brought back to the beginning of the episode as frylock explains about the grill and we realize that shake actually just daydreamed the whole story the show ends with shake giving a speech in which he implores the american people to stop global warming you must eat your boogers america 
 
the show opens with master shake and meatwad sitting around reminiscing about past events they eventually stray off topic into more extravagant tales like how hugh hefner invited shake to the playboy mansion concerned on how there were too few guys frylock reminds the two of how many times hes saved their lives accompanied by a clip montage mostly of him doing just that from past episodes accompanied by andrew wks song from party all the time shake tries to counter this by talking about how he picked out frylocks computer for him but fails to mention how he ran off to mexico when the bill arrived meatwad adds his own story about his first pubic hair which he found in his food at a restaurant and has been collecting them ever since and presents a shirt he presents it to frylock who suggests that carl may want it more during the phone call frylock coaxes carl over when he finds porn star tera patrick is inexplicably at their house what they dont mention is the shadowy grim reaper-like figure out in front of their door holding a line of gutter as carl approaches the house the reaper identifies himself as dan from grim reaper gutters and tries to sell him a gutter plan and tells him the company slogan that they wont leave without a sale after carls insistent refusal dan touches him with his skeletal hand and he drops dead this doesnt draw him from the aqua teens house however so frylock is forced to buy something the biggest plan they have after meatwad misunderstands a joke from shake to tera show us a bridge in new york he takes out a gun and commits suicide rated tv-ma 
 
as the episode begins frylock and meatwad are playing checkers in the aqua teens living room master shake enters and announces he has bad glaucoma and that his doctor said he needs to smoke marijuana to help him get better the mooninites arrive and say they grow marijuana on the moon called moonajuana at first to battle their own crippling illnesses but now simply for recreation against frylocks wishes shake and meatwad go off with ignignokt and err to get stoned 
rather than actually smoking cannabis the mooninites set fire to a pile of tires and wood in the driveway then lower a clear chamber shaped just like ignignokt over it holding in all the fumes claiming they are already very high the mooninites stay outside and watch as the typically clueless shake and meatwad stay inside the hood and get high act silly and eventually pass out this part of the plan accomplished they go to burgle the aqua teens house but are thwarted by frylock they then try their luck with carl asking if he would like to get high but he says that hed only do it if someone gave it to him the mooninites claim frylock has drugs and while carl is distracted break into his house however they are not interested in stealing carls possessions which mainly consist of new york giants memorabilia and pornography and thus decide to burn his house to the ground so no one else can have it 
carl fondly remembering his high school days of getting lit and listening to styx” joins shake and meatwad under the hood while the mooninites continue to try to trick frylock frylock grows tired and asks why they are always bothering the aqua teens considering there are so many other people on planet earth the mooninites claim they were never taught that there were so many people as they didnt have fathers growing up err gives a speech about how his parents left him and how he just steals to get attention hearing this frylock suggests that if they want attention they should go to los angeles and try out to be movie stars they take the advice and leave 
following this the aqua teens are seen watching a television drama featuring err as an extra playing a gay prostitute a man with questionable intent then approaches err and several other gay prostitutes shortly before opening fire on the group with an uzi 
 
a small milkshake looking just like master shake arrives at the aqua teens house calling shake daddy shake is very resistant to him claiming there is no proof that he can be his son frylock too doubts he could be shakes son since shake has no genitalia shake berates the small milkshake who runs off crying then threatens to take a bus to reno frylock and meatwad however like the little shake and decide to let him stay with them meatwad names him jesus ezekial jesus 
they play in carls pool where shake tries to drown ezekial by dropping a cinder block on him shake claims he did it since they cant afford college for him but frylock says that nobody is going to college and that he will work security at the mall when he gets older shake demands that ezekial be a professional basketball star when he grows up so they all go to a court and play during the game ezekial tries to make a far shot but misses they later begin playing a game of tennis in which shake plays badly and blames ezekial shake leaves in a huff and sits in carls car with the exhaust routed into it in an attempt to kill himself carl witnesses this and pulls him out not wanting his car to be ruined or to waste costly gasoline 
meatwad brings shake in the house to witness ezekial match wits with the chess dragon ezekial wins and the dragon leaves angrily meatwad congratulates him claiming no ones ever beaten the chess dragon shake says hes now proud to call ezekial his son but frylock claims thats impossible knowing hes never had sex frylock also says hes done a dna test showing ezekial is older than shake is ezekial states that he is 4000 years old shake does not believe there can be two talking milkshakes” the chess dragon then bursts through the roof and snatches ezekial who exclaims that he is going on an adventure frylock says well there were two talking milkshakes 
 
after two aliens build a large antenna attached to carls house carl and the aqua teens are enticed into watching the show the aliens broadcast - a show wherein the aliens do nothing but move the same boxes back and forth - despite their swelling heads and constant nosebleeds 
george lowe as himself 
 
meatwad responds to an ad in the newspaper and gets a job at carls car wash standing out on the highway in front of it waving and dancing to attract business but only gets cups full of coke thrown at him the proprietors of the business a large floating human-like brain named carl and his son carl jr who talks in quick gibberish feel their business is failing since meatwad can only shape shift into a hot dog or an igloo meatwad gets some help from frylock in trying some new shapes but eventually gives up he instead takes master shakes advice and tries unsuccessfully to antagonize their neighbor carl into getting his car washed by turning into a fist extending his middle finger then asking if he is a dumbass whos gonna get his ass whupped only when shake completely covers carls car with dirt does he take it to the car wash this a rare instance of shake helping meatwad without an ulterior motive or for personal gain except perhaps the joy he gets from tormenting carl 
at the car wash meatwad has him lie down on a gurney with an oxygen mask as they both watch his car go through the wash first getting the first half brushed then covered in dumpster juice which is a combination of rain water and garbage and is very acidic and very harsh on the paint job then cat urine then getting smashed with hammers then being repainted in a color of their choosing when carl protests gas pumps into the room and carl and carl jr arrive and after pointing out that he his son and carl have the exact same name demand his brain be removed a demand which shocks meatwad 
later carl with a giant hole in his head kneels by his completely defiled car mindlessly licking it shake condones this offering him a knife to remove his jaw so he can eat the car frylock eventually discovers what has happened and despite meatwads insistence that he may lose his job if they cause trouble they all go to the car wash the brains have carls brain propped up by the highway and are upset that it is not responding to their orders when carl the floating brain explains his plan of taking peoples brains to work at the car wash frylock dismisses it as retarded before frylock can do anything about it the brains leave saying they are closed but before they go inform them they will open at ten the next day

hitsugaya and ichimaru begin to fight and ichimaru initially takes the upper hand with his swordplay hitsugaya turns the tables by using the shikai of his zanpakutō to immobilize ichimaru by freezing his arm but this advantage is countered when ichimaru uses his own shikai to threaten the unconscious hinamori lieutenant rangiku matsumoto arrives to aid hinamori and hitsugaya and ichimaru withdraws rather than go against her meanwhile renji arrives at ichigos training spot and reveals that rukias execution date has been moved to the next day

suì-fēng recalls her past with yoruichi she was yoruichis personal guard and highly faithful to her however when yoruichi left soul society she felt betrayed and carried a grudge against her mentor from that point forward as suì-fēng attacks yoruichi uses her shunko to block all of suì-fēngs attacks suì-fēng breaks down in tears asking yoruichi why she did not take her along when she left soul society ikkaku and iba are fighting albeit casually for sake near the execution site ichigo uses his newly learned getsuga tenshō technique to defeat byakuyas shikai and requests that byakuya use his bankai

ichigo rukia and the modified souls enter kariyas mansion and confront kariya demanding that uryū be released while ichigo begins to fight udagawa rukia and the modified souls try to find uryū but are stopped by ichinose who tells rukia of how he became disillusioned with the 13 court guard squads when kenpachi became the captain of the eleventh division by killing the previous captain ichinose leaves to protect kariya when he notices that udagawa has stopped fighting ichigo and attempted to betray kariya ichinose kills udagawa and begins to fight with ichigo  
as ichinose and ichigo fight ichinose relates his past as a soul reaper as a member of the eleventh division he was horrified when kenpachi slew the previous captain and attempted to avenge his captain by killing kenpachi who easily defeats ichinose disillusioned ichinose left the soul society and encountered kariya to whom he swore his loyalty following this revelation kariya begins to fight ichigo and begins to overwhelm him as ururu begins to attack the mansion with her bazooka yoruichi carries ichigo to safety and the rest of the group retreats  
in the soul society mayuri kurotsuchi explains the bounts history to the other captains in the past the quincy and bount had a battle that the bount lost following this incident the bount began to consume living souls to increase their power as such mayuri concludes that the number of living souls attacked will escalate as the bounts become more active in karakura ichigo is depressed by his defeat by kariya ganju and renji both fight ichigo and after renji lectures him ichigo realizes how unfocused he has become  
ichigo and renji spend the entire night training under uraharas shop elsewhere yoshino fuses with goethe in order to increase her strength she attempts to kill kariya and he easily defeats her following her death he uses her body to create the bitto insects able to consume souls  
due to the lack of bount sightings urahara decides that he and renji should go and investigate the bount mansion and sends ichigo home with the modified souls to devise bount countermeasures lirin and kurōdo wear special suits to trick ichigo into thinking they are bounts as to get back at him but things go bad when rukia falls for the trick and continuously attacks them across town lirin kurōdo and noba present a variety of ideas but at the days end none of them are able to produce an actual anti-bount device  
in karakura town humans are being attacked by the bitto which suck out their souls and reduce their bodies into dust they then return to the bounts and provide them with purified souls to drink in order to increase their power members of suì-fēngs second division attack the bitto but they cannot damage them tenth division captain tōshirō hitsugaya orders more soul reapers to enter the human world noting that they cannot rely on ichigo alone meanwhile renji defends a human boy against a bitto assault

ichigo and renji arrive at the mouth of the cave and are quickly surrounded by gesell which takes the form of a large group of small one-eyed flying creatures they meet rangiku who tells them to destroy anything that can cast a shadow and they manage to defeat the creatures however they forget that their own bodies can also create shadows which is what ugaki uses to bring forth two sword arms luckily for them hisagi and kira come to help meanwhile uryū is visited by nemu who proceeds to attack uryū to confirm that he has lost his powers nemu then gives uryū a quincy battle accessory to allow him to use his powers

at the start chef ramsay asked each contestant to make their signature dish ramsay selected giacomos dish as the best heather and rachel received some praise for the taste of their dishes but chef ramsay felt that heathers dish was a bit too stodgy and disliked the chocolate and chilli sauce that rachels dish was served with the rest of the contestants signature dishes were not up to ramsays standards with ramsay spitting out maribels soup and toms scampi garrets meat and sarahs pasta were overcooked gabes fish and larrys crab cakes are under-cooked gordon did not even bother tasting pollys half-baked focaccia bread keiths tuna dish was far too large and hot and ramsay was really disappointed with virginia serving a salad that requires virtually no cooking 
chef ramsay made it clear that there were no winning team for the service but ramsay selected the men as the winners since they had served a few entrees and the women did not manage to serve any entrees heather was deemed the best of the worst during the service 
 
larry no reason was given for larrys departure however his photo was shown to be burned alongside gabe and giacomos photos in a montage at the start of episode 4 
gabe its absolutely crucial in hells kitchen to have finesse and passion it was pretty obvious that gabe had no passion

while naruto uzumaki battles sasuke uchiha kakashi hatake learns of sasukes defection from tsunade and is confronted by sakura haruno after trying to calm sakura down kakashi heads off to search for sasuke and naruto meanwhile believing naruto to be his closest friend sasuke prepares to kill him in hopes that narutos death would be an acceptable price for his sharingan to evolve into a mangekyo sharingan narutos rasengan and sasukes chidori clash though neither is capable of overpowering the other activating his cursed seal in order to gain an advantage sasuke mercilessly beats naruto but his chidori nearly hits narutos heart while sasuke thinks the battle to be won the nine-tailss chakra begins to envelop naruto as his wounds are healed as he resolves to beat sasuke to a bloodied pulp if that is what it will take to bring him home  
narutos newfound power overwhelms sasuke as he yells at naruto about not knowing how it feels to lose a family but naruto having known the pain of not having a family explains that he considers sasuke as a brother sasuke puts on his headband while proclaiming that naruto will not be able to hit it as he manages to fully develop his sharingan and is now able to read narutos quick movements and counterattack even when using shadow-clones sasuke manages to inflict numerous devastating and bone-crushing attacks on naruto it is not until sasuke slams him from the sky all the way to the ground that naruto is still and beaten needing more strength to fight naruto calls upon even more of the nine-tailss chakra as it covers his body due to the movement of the chakra cloak sasuke cannot read narutos movements this shroud also acts as a shield and sasukes attacks are quickly dispersed before reaching naruto the tangible chakra also acts as a potent weapon negating the sharingans prediction abilities and allowing naruto to attack from afar by extending the chakra into a claw-like attack as the demon fox-form continues its ravaging onslaught sasuke is put on the defensive forcing him to advance his cursed mark powers to its final level to compensate  
after activating stage 2 of his cursed mark sasuke transforms into a winged equal to naruto in power both remembering their time as teammates sasuke enlightens naruto that they are in the valley of the end and mentions the irony of it as a fitting place to settle things between them once and for all with naruto and sasuke at their peaks of power the two prepare their final attacks narutos nine-tails chakra infused rasengan and sasukes curse-mark enhanced chidori collide and forming a dome around the two boys as they exchanged numerous blows before sasuke slashes narutos chest with the last of his strength naruto succeeds leaving a deep scratch on sasukes headband standing over naruto sasuke attempts how impressed he was in his opponents last act before his headband fall off refusing to follow the same path as his brother and also remembering what naruto means to him sasuke decides to gain power his own way and heads to orochimaru kakashi arrives soon after to see a knocked-out and injured naruto carrying him away while unaware that a mysterious member of the akatsuki had watched the entire fight unfold from underground  
briefly coming to on kakashis back as the rest of the sasuke retrival team is brought back to the hidden leaf to make full recovery naruto learns that sasuke escaped once fully recovered in his hospital bed naruto talks to shikamaru nara of how he failed to get sasuke eavesdropping on them and reluctant to enter until tsunade arrived to check up on naruto sakura resolves to hide her sadness to cheer her team mate up as he apologizes to her for not keeping his promise but sakura tells him that theyll get sasuke back together when another chance comes jiraiya offers naruto a chance to leave with him for three years to train to defend himself against orochimaru and the akatsuki naruto rebukes his offer saying that he needs to focus on saving his friend first though jiraiya tries to convince him that sasuke is beyond the point of return naruto refuses to accept it and vows to become strong enough to get sasuke back though seeing the boys intent foolish jiraiya decides to help naruto and agrees to train him when he is ready elsewhere as sasuke arrives to orochimarus lair to become his apprentice the akatsuki assemble to discuss the new turn of events while their leader tells them that their mission is more vital  
jiraiya begins to worry about naruto and sakuras well-being he then requests that tsunade send the two on a mission with him he finds naruto telling sakura he is not going to stop her from going after sasuke but he is going with her and tells them about the mission they head off to the land of rice fields to find the hidden sound village and hopefully sasuke as well

sasame leads naruto jiraiya and sakura to orochimarus hideout they send sasame back to the village because of the danger level jiraiya summons gamakichi to go in first and investigate the four come to three tunnels jiraiya goes off to the right naruto and sakura down the middle and gamakichi down the left through the tunnels they find several deadly booby-traps and dangers naruto easily falls for the first but manages to rescue sakura from the rest it comes to the point where there is a trap-door in which naruto saves sakura from falling into it himself he tells her to go on without him sakura trusts him and leaves naruto ends up in a dark room with many bamboo sticks and struggles to get freemeanwhile as sakura enters a large vacant room she battles kabuto yakushi and orochimaru who already have the upper hand  
in the room narutos in he encounters gamakichi who seems to be of no use in his struggle the room soon floods with water sakura attempts to battle kabuto telling him that she believes naruto and herself will save sasuke together she soon loses focus when kabuto begins harassing her with thoughts of sasukes inevitable death he states that  sasuke is already dead and you two can meet with him in the afterlife she begins sobbing and remains still as kabuto is about to murder her naruto arrives in the nick of time to save sakura but she is stull petrified in tears naruto tells her not to believe him takes her away and a battle ensues naruto battles kabuto viciously using shadow-clones but kabuto defeats them with a fire technique eventually naruto corners and defeats him with the rasengan injuring him badly although appeared defeated kabuto traps him in some chakra threads immune to normal blades that connect their hearts if kabutos heart stops so will narutos he states that he is willing to sacrifice himself to please orochimaru  
naruto takes on arashi but gets trapped and beaten easily sakura thinks hes dead and naruto ends up blowing his sneak attack cover to protect her getting pierced by the spine naruto tries his attack again but his injury causes a problem naruto gets trapped in an attack that will crush him if he doesnt get out sasame attacks arashi and manages to set him free for a second however it doesnt last long and he soon tries to kill sasame sakura jumps in the way and says she will give her life to protect her friends naruto tells her she cant die and arashi tries to finish naruto off sasame causes enough of a distraction for naruto to break free the attack caused by naruto frees arashi and arashi protects sasame from the monster that was part of his body the place begins to collapse and jiraiya arrives arashi throws them out and tells them he cant leave since he is a puppet he tells naruto that sasuke is alive and they all leave leaving arashi behind the fuma clan promises to rebuild their town and everyone heads back to konoha considering herself to have been of little use sakura asks to become tsunades pupil and learn to become a medical ninja she also meets naruto in the hospital and thanks him insisting that next time she would help him save sasuke

naruto is having trouble with the two brothers and iruka is having his share of difficulties with mizuki iruka struggles to try to get the old mizuki back but mizuki explains the only reason he was ever nice to iruka was because he wanted to be the hokages favorite too he wanted iruka to be miserable and not to have everyone else be so kind to iruka and not himself iruka and mizuki then prepare to fight again meanwhile after many shadow clone attacks naruto finally has a chance to use rasengan the brothers accidentally destroy their lunch and make narutos attack hit his shadow clones as they prepare to kill him shikamaru choji and ino come to the rescue

luffy sanji zoro and chopper follow usopps bloody trail to the franky house where they find him passed out in front the four of them challenge the franky family only to find out that their real target franky himself is gone and has taken the money with him  
once theyre back on the ship luffy has to finally tell usopp that the going merry can no longer be repaired and that theyve chosen to get a new ship without him usopp believes that luffy has abandoned the dignity of their ship and says hes leaving the crew that night he challenges luffy to a duel  
usopp fights luffy in order to decide who keeps the going merry he fights harder than hes ever fought before luffy actually seems to pose no threat but all the while hes remembering what great friends they used to be sailing together on the same ship even after taking a harsh beating luffy defeats usopp they leave usopp and the ship behind  
the strawhats get themselves a hotel room nami finds the crew on the roof with urgent news iceburg has been shot as the galley la company frantically search for answers nami and luffy decide to check on his condition – only to be met by closed gates franky appears then to exact his revenge – with style  
in the streets outside of the hospital luffy fights franky inside iceburg recalls seeing nico robin and another tall man before he was shot the galley la company run outside and stop franky and luffy and tell them that they suspect the strawhat pirates of the crime  
the galley la company continues to fight luffy and franky is enraged that theyve stolen his opponent an incredibly high tide called the aqua laguna is coming and chopper and sanji rush to warn usopp luffy raises some chaos in order to meet with iceburg and he demands to know whats happening iceburg says he wants to see robin one more time  
in a bar franky talks with kokoro about her theory on who shot iceburg the rumors she speaks of seem to have some truth as we see robin meeting with someone from an organization called cp9 while the crew hide from angry residents sanji and chopper discover robin and she tells them what theyve feared shes responsible and she wants to part ways  
chopper reunites with the others without sanji and they discuss whats happened luffy decides that in order to know the full truth they must catch robin usopp attempts to repair the ship enough to withstand the aqua laguna and the strawhats make their way to the galley la company  
the strawhats still missing sanji rush to galley la where robin and cp9 begin a raid in iceburgs room robin and the mysterious man iceburg saw before tell him that theyve purposely placed the blame on the pirates their true aim is the blueprints he wouldve passed down to paulie luffy separates from his group  
robin speaks with iceburg inside his room still we already know that robin can read the poneglyphs - and it seems iceburg is the one with the blueprints to the ultimate weapon pluton the true enemies are revealed to be iceburgs own allies elsewhere luffy is tied up with paulie after paulie tells members of cp9 that his blueprints are fake  
lucci tells iceburg their hypothesis and has kaku check his pulse to tell if the things he tells him are true they suspect that iceburgs friend from the past cutty flam is really franky and its revealed to be true therefore franky has the real blueprints the strawhat pirates and paulie break into the room where they find iceburg and cp9  
luffy and the others request that robin comes back to the crew she refuses and tells them that she cannot accomplish her wish if she were to stay with them robin turns to leave and cp9 try to hold the pirates back robin successfully escapes and lucci shows those remaining his transformation  
luccis transformation is a result of a devils fruit a zoan type leopard he quickly disposes of the crew and cp9 tie up paulie and iceburg leaving them alone as the building slowly burns down around them in frankys underground hideout usopp tells him his story and franky is finally touched in return franky tells him a little about toms contributions to water seven  
usopp believes that the person who repaired the going merry in skypeia was really the going merry itself franky says that the ship was inhabited by a spirit who enters ships who are dearly cared for the spirit repaired their ship just enough for them to reach the next island the doorbell rings from the sea side and the galley la foremen enter  
the foremen discover frankys hidden room and he fears theyll trample his memories a long flashback ensues covering frankys past in toms workers and how he and iceburg helped create the sea train

frankys flashback franky said that if a ship of his were to be used as a weapon then its no longer one of his ships that enraged tom and he punched franky for the first time telling him he had to take pride in the ships he created he then told the judge that he would accept the punishment for both his previous crime and the recent attack franky tried to stop the train to enies lobby with his bare hands  
chopper escapes the burning building with paulie and iceburg on his back and collapses outside iceburg tells nami that cp9 threatened to destroy the straw hats if robin didnt cooperate with them nami rushes to tell chopper so they can go looking for the rest of the crew elsewhere the foremen let go of the going merry so she would be destroyed at sea  
paulie helps clear the name of the strawhats but doesnt tell the mob everything he knows he gets the mob to follow chopper so they can search for the rest of the crew nami goes her own way so she can rush to the sea train as nami nears the station sanji ahead of her approaches the train  
nami and the conductors are rescued by paulie when the aqua laguna floods the main station a man hands nami a letter he found from sanji it informs her that usopp franky and he are on board the train that had just departed on board he storms the cars high up in the city nami speaks with kokoro and spots luffy stuck in between two buildings in the back streets where the aqua laguna will hit first  
nami finally reaches luffy and tells him that he needs to hurry before robin reaches enies lobby chopper finds zoro and hands him the sandai kitetsu so he can escape the chimney luffy pushes apart the buildings he was stuck between and paulie grabs them all so they can escape the aqua lagunas massive wave

after hiding under robins cloak for a few episodes sogeking finally shows himself they stumble into the room with the cp9 and meet with sanji and franky sogeking produces a smokescreen the four head into another car detach it and escape its not long before blueno pulls their car back though franky knocks down the wall so they can escape but ends up on the enemy car blueno opens a door then back in the strawhat car  
robin willingly follows blueno into his improvised door and sogeking and sanji are left alone for a while blueno explains a little of robins past involving the buster call back at the rocket man yokuzuna the frog jumps onto the front of the train knocking them from the rails after kokoro speaks with him he joins the group the cp9 franky and robin finally reach enies lobby and disembark  


robin and franky are brought before spandam while luffy blasts through waves of marines the galley-la foremen and the franky family eventually slip by oimo and open the second gate however their joy is short-lived as a group of marines closes the first gate behind them to overcome the unanticipated obstacle zoro changes the plan yokozuna bends the islands outside fence downward using it as a ramp the sea train jumps over both of the gates and crash lands into oimos back finishing him off and concluding everyones arrival at the main island as the elite group—called laws watch dog unit—enters the fight on the side of the marines the battle escalates in intensity  
the straw hats struggle to catch up with luffy but get caught up in impeding each others efforts sanji and zoro indulge themselves in petty bickering and nami injures her crewmates by testing her newly improved weapon the streets appear empty abandoned by the men who were fighting luffy just then the laws watch dog unit and a large group of other men step into their way a fight seems inevitable until their allies riding the king bulls arrive paulie uses his ropes to pull the crew onto the back of one of the large animals then the galley-la foremen replace straw hats in battle to allow the rest of the group to escape  
spandam tells robin that her crew has come to save her and that he despite the agreement between her and the cp9 plans on taking them prisoner on the main road the straw hats and the franky family proceed towards the courthouse plaza chopper talks with the king bull named sodom who notes that sogeking did not make it onto his back meanwhile frustrated with his inability to move forward luffy slingshots himself onto the courthouse there blueno is awaiting his arrival  
oimo explains to sogeking about how he and kāshī came to support the marines—the marines told them that they arrested their bosses the story reminds sogeking of the giants dorry and broggy whom the straw hats met shortly after entering the grand line sodom the king bull incurs severe damage and urges the straw hats riding him to continue without him quickly they board sodoms brother gomorrah and continue on atop of the courthouse the fight between blueno and luffy begins luffy throws the first punch and seems far less inferior than during their last encounter  
kokoro and her granddaughter chimeney contact the straw hats by means of namis portable transponder snail phone they inform them of luffys location and instruct them on how to lower the courthouses drawbridge the franky family decides to lower it just then the second of enies lobbys elite units enters the battle one of the guilty jurymen throws his massive iron ball at gomorrah knocking him down behind them sogeking is riding to the courthouse on the shoulders of one of the giants with whom he has managed to ally gomorrah arising again despite severe injury tells those riding him to hold on as he plans to take them to their destination inside the tower of law kaku and kalifa hesitatingly eat the devil fruits that spandam has given them  
although gomorrah was blinded he continues on sanji and zoro crush a building in the king bulls path and the party arrives at the courthouse on the other side of the drawbridge spandam is brought a transponder snail phone with an urgent report confident that he will only be told of the straw hats capture he allows robin and franky to listen in letting them know of their rescuers success in front of the courthouse zoro cuts open the buildings immense stone door the franky family split into three groups two of which storm the drawbridge towers to reach the levelers at their tops on the courthouses roof luffy and blueno fight on even terms until luffy activates his newest technique the gear second  
the straw hats storm the courthouse where the remaining members of the franky family fight the three-headed judge baskerville and aided by yokozuna block the buildings entrance to cut off reinforcements above them luffys gear second is put into action against bluno while his crew fight their way upstairs on the main road the giants have defeated the laws watch dog unit and with sogeking and the galley-la foremen are heading for the plaza luffy defeats blueno steps past his unconscious body and cries out for robin to hear that he has arrived  
franky cannot understand why robin refuses to be saved after spandam broke his promise while luffy yells in the background franky decides to make robin face him he uses his remaining cola to inflate his buttocks and with a giant flatus shoots himself and robin outside onto the balcony and into luffys sight breaking his chains in the process luffy wants to slingshot himself over the waterfall to rescue robin but she tells him to stay and that only she wants to die in front of the courthouse yokozuna succumbs to the jurymens attacks the marines are about to pour in as the giants arrive and assume control of the position kāshī throws sogeking onto the courthouse where he joins the assembling straw hats gathering on the battlements they face robin and the cp9 while they wait for the drawbridge to be lowered  
twenty years into the past robin is growing up on the island of ohara her aunt with whom she lives while her mother is away doing research treats her poorly other children ostracize her studying in the worlds greatest library the tree of omniscience in the hopes of being allowed to help the local archeologists in their forbidden research robin earns the rank of a scholar in archaeology at age eight however when she announces her intention to help her request is denied because of her youth disappointed at being rejected again she walks along the shore where she stumbles on jaguar d saulo a giant and deserted vice-admiral of the navy the two become friends and saulo teaches her to laugh  
saulo is shocked to learn that robin is nico olvias daughter and that he has been washed up on the shores of ohara olvia who returned to the island on a stolen navy ship hurries to the tree of omniscience to warn her colleagues of a coming navy fleet however she is too late the government ship that carried spandams father spandaine and his men has already arrived they frighten the islands population into boarding an evacuation ship while the government soldiers arrest the scholars and search the library professor clover robins mentor urges robin to board the evacuation ship but she refuses as it becomes clear that the scholars will not be forgiven for their forbidden research clover asks to be allowed to speak to the heads of the government known as the five elder stars  
professor clover is allowed to speak with one of the elder stars and reports of their research he describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the world government assumed power he considers the collective evidence which leads him to believe that the government tried to erase their former enemies from history after stating that ohara has learned too much the elder star orders spandaine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island suddenly the library is set aflame while the scholars try to save the books robin admits to being an archeologist and unites with her mother however their union does not last long around them cannon shots from the buster calls battleships start to hail down and olvia sends her daughter off with saulo to flee the island while she joins the effort to save the librarys knowledge  
saulo fights the battleships attempting to allow robin to escape she tries to board the evacuation ship but per spandaines orders she is denied access vize-admiral kuzan later known as admiral aokiji enters the scene to engage in battle with saulo while they fight the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical vice-admiral sakazuki later known as admiral akainu saulo on the verge of dying instructs robin to flee on his raft persuaded by saulos argument and sakazukis action kuzan helps robin escape from then on robin lives a life on the run not being able to trust even the kindest of people in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin in the present robin admits her greatest fear to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away because being with her means having the world as their enemy finally knowing what kept her away sogeking on luffys order burns the governments flag declaring war against the world government itself

namis backstory is summarized  
a simple question is answered if the straw hat pirates were all middle-aged women who would be the strongest  
the backstories of sanji and chopper are summarized  
the reasons for nico robins recent actions as well as her backstory are summarized  
franky had hidden the blueprints for the ancient weapon pluton within his body he shows them to the cp9 explaining that they were only kept in existence so that an opposing force could be constructed in case the other ancient weapons still in existence were revived by robin having realized that she is not the demon that rumors characterized her as he bets the worlds fate on the straw hats ability to rescue her and burns the blueprints enraged spandam throws franky off the balcony kokoro runs rocketman up the half-lowered drawbridge the straw hats informed via transponder snail phone jump aboard hitting franky on the way and carrying him along the train jumps over the waterfall and crashes into the tower of law  
unburying themselves from the rubble their entry has caused the straw hats are greeted by fukurou he tells them that in the tower including himself there are five cp9 members each carrying a key one of whom unlocks the sea stone handcuffs on robin he also tells them that lucci and spandam have already taken robin to the gates of justice the straw hats split up luffy chases after robin while the rest pursue the keys meanwhile chimeney and her pet rabbit gonbe find a secret passage as they explore it their attention is caught by the villainous laughter of chief spandam  
zoro and kaku engage in an intense sword fight directly beneath them sogeking fails to steal a key from the sleeping cp9 assassin jyabura eventually kaku makes use of his newly gained devil fruit power he transforms into a giraffe causing the floor to collapse he and zoro fall down a story interrupting the fight between sogeking and jyabura the fighting halts as everyone entertains themselves by making fun of kakus ridiculous appearance enraged kaku uses his new power to vertically cut the building in half as the confusion subsides zoro and sogeking realize that they accidentally handcuffed themselves together meanwhile luffy searches high and low for the tower of law for robin and her captors  
their prey cuffed together kaku and jyabura offer to use their keys to free them however neither of their keys open the locks chopper passes by and is sent off to obtain the correct key from one of the other assassins sanji attempts to get the key of kalifa nami only barely escapes from kumadori as chopper rescues her in the last second having stolen his key the two try to get away they stop as sanji glossy and in a rounded-off shape falls down besides the staircase once she notices kalifa a few levels up nami figures that sanji went easy on her and decides to take over  
luffy attempts to cross the wild waters on the far side of the tower of law chimeney and gonbe arrive just in time to save him from drowning they show him the way to the underground passage through which they had seen spandam and lucci take robin it is blocked by a large steel door luffy activates his gear third and breaks it meanwhile franky is forced to fight fukurou with just a few drops of cola left in his stomach compartment fortunately for him their scuffle leads them into the kitchen where chopper locks kumadori into the fridge  
refreshed after having placed three full bottles of cola in his stomach compartment franky turns the tide in his battle with fukurou after breaking through a few walls they continue fighting outside they fall into the sea and by the force of the currents are drawn towards the waterfall surrounding enies lobbys main island franky barely saves himself from falling down by grabbing onto fukurous leg with his extendable arm unable to shake off his opponent fukurou is forced to use his air-walking technique to drag both of them towards land as they close in on the tower of law he attempts to crush franky into it however franky is prepared and holds onto his opponent with his dividable legs and uses his air pressure cannon to propel him flying into the ground  
choppers breather concludes as kumadori frees himself from the fridge apparently after he finished eating its contents at first he is fat but he digests all the food immediately and is slim again fascinated chopper asks how he did it kumadori willingly explains afterwards the two resume their fight where it had stopped chopper quickly realizes that he cannot break through kumadoris body-hardening technique without the effect of his rumble ball drug having used a first while rescuing nami he dares not use a second out of fear of its side effects nevertheless he takes it chopper charges repeatedly but his transformations are erratic and difficult to control by the time he assumes the correct form he is too weak and is struck down left with one choice he steps into the forbidden realm of taking a third rumble ball  
in the edo period-based alternate reality grand jipangu the small girl rika takes an ill person whom everyone calls tot-san which means father in japanese to her house to nurse him back to health organized crime boss buggy the clown and one of the towns highest officials scheme to get rid of detective luffy mistaking rika to be the daughter of tot-san buggy kidnaps her to collect tot-sans debt when luffy comes to rescue her the high official attempts to exile him for attacking an innocent citizen instead he himself is stripped of his position for joining forces with criminals by the shoguns daughter vivi  
it is the seventh day of the new year in grand jipangu nami sanji and chopper are on their way to the shoguns castle delivering a large quantity of rice cakes to be thrown from the castle most of the townspeople have gathered there hoping to catch the one cake containing a precious jewel buggy and his henchmen have made several plans to seize the cakes including the one with the jewel before they reach their destination although his plans fail buggy manages to take princess vivi hostage however detective luffy shows up in time to thwart his efforts in the end the cakes are safe and everyone eats until they are satisfied  
having taken three rumble balls chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct driven version of himself kumadori goes all out to defeat his enemy but in the end cannot succeed in kalifas room nami lies helplessly on the ground watching her opponent casually bathing slowly the strength returns to her limbs while kalfi redresses shortly into their fight nami discovers the essence of kalifas new ability being a soap woman she can create a foam that washes away anything even a persons strength chopper goes on a rampage and with franky on his heels climbs the towers outside walls having crossed the underground passage luffy finally catches up to lucci  
on the courthouse plaza the marines defeat oimo and kāshī and capture the straw hats allies in the courthouse almost on the bridge of hesitation which leads through the gates of justice spandam tries to contact the cp9 members at the tower but accidentally invokes a buster call causing ten battleships and five vice-admirals to be dispatched to enies lobby from the nearby navy headquarters realizing his first mistake spandam makes another by informing the whole island of the coming threat out of fear the islands 10000 soldiers leave their prisoners and flee to the coast  
lucci and luffy begin their mutually anticipated duel while nami and kalifas fight enters the next phase both combatants have scouted out each others abilities kalifa attempts to finish nami off just then chopper in his monstrous form crushes through the wall and enters the fight he does not recognize nami just as he did not recognize franky as he goes through the room he rips out kalifas large bathing tub and throws it downstairs where the immobilized sanji is sitting nami is deeply worried about chopper but before she can help him she has to finish her fight the torn up water pipes sprinkling the rooms air provide a possible advantage for her  
the fight between nami and kalifa climaxes kalifa sweeps the room with a tidal wave of power-draining bubbles to counter namis illusions barely escaping nami manages to prepare and release her finishing blow in the form of a horizontal lighting bolt franky who had followed chopper in climbing up the walls of the tower of law arrives as she is about to retrieve kalifas key a moments discussion later they conceive of a plan they follow chopper into the room where zoro and sogeking still cuffed together try to fight kaku and jyabura there franky uses his air pressure cannon to blast chopper outside and into the sea while nami uses kalifas key to release zoro and sogeking from their shackles  
having pulled the once-again tiny but now completely unconscious chopper out of the sea franky ponders on how he can cross the wild waters to reach the bridge of hesitation chimeney and gonbe appear outside the secret passage and lead him to kokoro and the underground tunnel in the last remaining fight at the tower of law zoro and kaku exchange heavy blows while jyabura takes on sogeking and nami the latter fight ends quickly as jyabura holding the unmoving body of sogeking aims his killing blow just then sanji freed from the influence of kalifas power by the water of the bathtub that chopper had thrown downstairs earlier steps in taking his place in the fight  
nami drags the wounded sogeking from the fighting zone as she is on the verge of going downstairs sogeking has an idea meanwhile sanji starts exchanging blows with jyabura who sends him flying into the hallway continuing their fight there jyabura tries in vain to trick sanji with a made-up story of being robins long-lost brother the battle seems even until the wolf-man gains the upper hand over his opponent with well-placed blows realizing that he is on the losing side sanji resolves to use his newest technique he spins around until his leg starts glowing red with heat and defeats jyabura in a fierce mid-air final  
spandam drags robin along the bridge of hesitation while beneath them lucci is blocking the way upstairs franky arrives and offers to help fight lucci however luffy insists that franky save robin reminded of himself when he was young and tried to stop the sea train from carrying away his mentor franky agrees to do so though he has to get past lucci at the same time in the tower of law kaku shows zoro the many tricks he can perform with his body that is now equipped with devil fruit powers discovering new techniques in the process  
after many failed attempts zoro finally cuts kaku shortly afterwards their fight climaxes as both combatants use their ultimate techniques the victor is zoro on the other side of the raging waters on the bridge of hesitation spandam continues to drag robin along fear strikes her as the end of the bridge which for her marks the point of no return comes into sight she pulls herself free and runs away spandam pursues and recaptures her but she holds on to the rim of the bridge with her teeth below them franky tries in vain to force his way past the much more powerful lucci as franky is on the verge of being killed luffy activates gear second and attacks lucci allowing franky to slip by  
having loosened robins tooth grip on the bridges rim spandam ties a rope around her waist and pulls her further along during this he constantly insults her and proudly tells her that spandaine the man who had caused her so much suffering is his father a stream of tears runs down her cheeks as her time runs out just then and seemingly out of nowhere an explosive projectile hits the back of spandams head a stream of projectiles falls on the marines gathered around him outside the range of normal guns sogeking is shooting at them standing on top of the tower of law  
freed from her sea stone handcuffs by franky robin returns to her normal self with no way back the two decide to capture the ship spandam had intended to use to bring robin to the navy headquarters the buster call ships arrive and start by shooting at the tower of law causing its dangerously positioned upper half to crush down into the waterfall the resulting loud noise created reaches luffy and lucci beneath the bridge of hesitation anticipating that the straw hats would emerge through the underground passage lucci tears a hole into a wall of the underwater chamber flooding it and the passage  
it is springtime in grand jipangu one day remains until the yearly town festival in which everyone gathers to have a picnic under the 1000-year-old sakura tree unfortunately one of the towns children is sick and cannot attend luffy tries to think of a way to show him the tree in its bloom but does not come up with a solution when the tree disappears the next day luffy becomes the prime suspect robin investigates the truth is that buggy and his men stole the tree and brought it aboard the ship of foxy the silver fox she tips off luffy usopp and sanji about the trees location who go there to retrieve it  
the buster call ships have reached the island guns blazing they pass the bridge of hesitation at the same time the remaining straw hats kokoro chimeney and gonbe have entered the underground passage and are running towards the water streaming in on the other end meanwhile luffy and lucci having fled from the rising water continue their fight a few levels higher because the effects of his gear second have worn off luffy is at a disadvantage however he has another trump card he activates gear third blows air into his arm until it reaches the size of that of a giant and knocks lucci out of the pillar  
fifteen years into the past a 13-year-old rob lucci as emissary of the world government is sent into a country at war with pirates five hundred of their soldiers have been taken hostage and the pirates captain demands the throne in exchange for the mens life the countrys king is close to giving in when lucci arrives however lucci has not come to offer help but to take matters into his hands he goes to the pirates and allows them to capture him they lock him up with the five hundred soldiers lucci kills them all in the name of justice because for a soldier it is a sin to be weak afterwards he kills the pirates captain and ends the countrys crisis  
after fighting lucci in gear third for a minute luffy is left to cope with the techniques side effect of his body shrinking to a fraction of its original size for around the same time at the other end of the bridge of hesitation franky takes on funkfreed spandams sword infused with the powers of a devil fruit which allow it to partly or completely turn into an elephant at the islands entry the two giants arrive carrying the galley-la foremen and the franky family on their shoulders instead of finding a means of escape however they are greeted by the cannon muzzles of three of the buster calls battleships equally desperate is the situation in the underground passage where the group has been caught in the flooding-in water just as they are about to give up hope a mermaid comes to their rescue  
franky and robin are throwing the last remaining marines off their commandeered convoy ship when kokoro in mermaid form jumps out of the water and on board carrying the whole group from the underground passage a moment of happiness arises as they reunite with robin but does not last long the battleships have set the whole island aflame and via loudspeaker a voice announces the destruction of the group of escapees at the main gate with no more targets left the fleet turns its attention toward the bridge of hesitation where the straw hats are forced to wait for their captains arrival  
the fight between luffy and lucci is nearing its end as the cp9 assassin makes use of his most powerful technique the six kings gun the bridge of hesitation is surrounded by battleships which using their cannons sever the bridges first pillar where luffy is fighting from the rest having cut off the straw hats captains retreat the marines send their two hundred strongest fighters to recapture robin meanwhile luffy is no longer able to stand up to luccis attacks and falls to the ground  
while the rest of the straw hats struggle to hold their own against the buster calls fighting elite usopp unmasked cannot believe his eyes seeing luffy lying in the dust in front of lucci he cries out to him telling him to hang in and stand up however luffy cannot move in his desperation he insults lucci dares him to cross the destroyed bridge and fight him presuming luffy to be defeated lucci is about to follow usopps suggestion however luffy gets back on his feet and activates gear second in preparation for the final round lucci hits him one more time with his six kings gun and is sure of victory however luffy does not fall he turns around and ends the fight with a barrage of blows  
familiar voices are heard from the navys loudspeakers calling in from the far side of the island the franky family and galley-la foremen are telling them that they survived and have found a means of escape the straw hats are not so fortunate their stolen convoy ship is blown up by a salvo of battleship fire another salvo destroys the second half of the bridge of hesitation forcing the pirates onto the middle pillar the situation worsens as the marines see the state of luffy worn out from the fight and from overusing gear second he cannot move or run as the battleships aim their mighty cannons at him things seem hopeless until the group hears another voice calling out to them they jump into the ocean  
the voice had come from the straw hats ship the going merry sanji is the first to go aboard to his surprise nobody is there the ship had made it from water 7 to enies lobby on its own the straw hats have little time to spare because the battleships have already taken aim at the tiny ship that has snuck in between them they fire a salvo almost from point-blank range but miss while absent earlier sanji found the control room for the gates of justice and set it to close the large gate in its original position creates whirl streams strong enough to disturb the battleships aim as well as their ability to maneuver which allows the straw hats to escape  
enies lobby and the buster call fleet are out of sight the straw hats meet the galley-la president iceburg and his employees aboard their company ship the going merry breaks apart and luffy begs the shipwrights to repair the beloved ship but they refuse iceburg then describes how he had found the ship lying at the shore and had done everything to fix it convincing luffy to let it go reminiscing about their adventures together the straw hats burn their old ship and watch as it sinks to the bottom of the sea  
two days later and back in water 7 franky hears that the item has arrived he had used the money which he had stolen from the straw hats to buy a large piece of precious wood using the wood he plans to build a dream ship and offers to give it to the straw hats the promise of a new ship and the recovery of their lost possessions from a group of galley-la workers brightens the straw hats outlook however another cloud darkens the horizon as a group of marines led by vice-admiral garp break into their quarters  
garp is revealed to be luffys grandfather and is accompanied by old acquaintances of luffy and zoro from the beginning of their journey coby and helmeppo after giving luffy a lecture for becoming a pirate instead of a marine he tells him about his father monkey d dragon although luffy does not know of it he was once saved by him in loguetown where he was almost captured by captain smoker  
garp takes his leave to let luffy alone with coby and helmeppo so that they can chat afterwards coby thanks luffy and zoro for the opportunity to meet them again and promises to become stronger so he might one day capture them once he and helmeppo depart the straw hats start a party at the galley-las company pool during that party aokiji approaches robin while staying out of sight he explains to her that saul was his best friend and that he had only let her go to honor his wishes he admits that he had decided to put an end to robins existence always on the run and the danger it meant for the world but that her and the straw hats actions have shown him that she has found her place  
a fleet of navy ships could not keep the red-haired shanks and whitebeard from meeting those unprepared to bear his presence fall unconscious to the ground as shanks walks over the planks of whitebeards ship carrying a large bottle of booze while they drink they reminisce about old times and wounds which begin aching again shanks asks his peer to stop his subordinate portgas d ace from pursuing blackbeard whitebeard refuses the two draw their weapons and fight  
luffy and chopper help a girl named abi to search for her lost yagara bull which had appeared to her in a dream during the aqua laguna her family had left their 100-year-old bull at home when they returned after the storm he was gone the three search all over the city for him with no success another yagara claims to have heard the missing ones voice after finding a piece of his scarf they track him into the underwater passages of the city however they only find an illusion abi is devastated then they hear the voice of a yagara baby wrapped in the rest of the old ones scarf  
zoro strolls the city in search of a replacement katana but does not have money there he is picked up by michael and hoichael two idle boys from the backstreets they show him around and call him their big brother before he knows what is happening he is introduced to their mother is taken home with them and has to feed babies and make laundry he struggles to escape eventually succeeding shortly afterward the family is taken away by violent debt collectors alerted by one of the boys zoro arrives just in time to save them  
sanji is buying groceries in the company of chimeney and gonbe for lunch they lead him to the small floating restaurant of a drunken old man he is asleep and not easily woken so sanji decides to prepare something himself while he is cooking the old man wakes up and immediately recognizes sanjis way of handling the carving knife for he knew sanjis mentor red-leg zeff he insists that sanji taste some of his cooking sanji is amazed by the flavor but cannot figure out how the old man made it intent on discovering the secret he searches the city for seasonings that might have been used perchance he gets to eat an onigiri made by the old man and realizes that he uses a special salt the salt was created by aqua laguna as the storm floods the lower parts of the city it covers the buildings with sea water in the following sunny days particularly tasty residual salt is left on the rooftops  
franky iceburg and the galley-la foremen work throughout the night to build the new ship for the straw hats usopp spends the time practicing the manner in which he will convince his former crewmates to let him join again the next day the straw hats are summoned to the shore to receive their ship on departing they are intercepted by the franky family bringing the new wanted posters of the crew however the true reason they came is that franky has received a bounty as well they fear that should he stay with them he might be captured once more and that they would not be able to rescue him again therefore they beg the straw hats to take franky with them regardless of whether he wants them to or not  
when the straw hats arrive at the coast iceburg shows them the ship but franky cannot be found iceburg gives his opinion franky is hiding because if he were asked face to face to join the crew he would not be able to refuse he wants to go but thinks of staying in water 7 as his responsibility on the other side of the island frankys men literally take the matter into their own hands they steal frankys beloved jammer-style swimsuit and attempt to lure him to the straw hats by passing it back and forth to each other midway sanji and zoro seize him put him into the franky familys shoot-anything-cannon and have him shot in front of the new ship  
luffy tells franky that if he wants his swimsuit back he will have to join his crew however this does not persuade him to weaken his resolve robin uses her ability to grab frankys testicles and pulls on them iceburg tells him that he only wants to stay in water 7 because he has not forgiven himself frankys followers bring him his luggage he rejects it telling them to stay out of his affairs during this series of events franky cries apparently from the pain inflicted by robin who had stopped some time ago sanji and zoro arrive in a hurry reporting that garp has returned and is on his way to capture them luffy then returns the swimsuit to franky who subsequently agrees to join the crew  
the straw hats set sail even though usopp has not yet returned to them because zoro had promised that if usopp was allowed to return without his first words being an apology zoro would leave himself even if they wanted to wait longer they could not because garp has arrived and under direct orders of fleet-admiral sengoku starts throwing cannonballs at the straw hats ship while the straw hats fend of the cannonballs usopp arrives at the coast and tries to rejoin the crew as if nothing happened minding zoros words neither he nor luffy admit hearing usopps calling in the midst of battle only afterward usopp realizes his fault and begs for forgiveness luffy tearfully reaches out and pulls him aboard  
because the crew and ship are complete again the straw hats can intensify their efforts to escape they name their new ship thousand sunny and franky goes to the engine room to activate one of its special abilities luffy says goodbye to his grandfather and coby enraged by his grandsons audacity garp pulls out a gigantic iron ball and throws it at him and his ship at the last second the sunnys emergency acceleration device activates and blasts the ship a kilometer away and outside garps reach meanwhile the crews wanted posters and news of their deeds at enies lobby circulate around the world  
three days earlier and on an island close to water 7 blackbeard receives the news of the straw hats devastation of enies lobby and decides to pursue them however his plans are interrupted by ace who has come to avenge blackbeards murder of a crewmate teach claims that he had no other choice for the man he killed possessed the devil fruit he wanted which he had been searching for his entire life he then asks ace to join him however ace refuses they start fighting and blackbeard reveals his newfound power the power of darkness the island is devastated and ace defeated  
after departing water 7 the straw hats find a drifting ship with hungry and sick fishermen all things seem great until the drifting fishermen have something else in mind and set a trap for the straw hats  
the straw hats find themselves surrounded by a fleet of marine ships actually illusions they escape using the soldier dock system with the fishermen in tow chopper meanwhile is told by jiro about their past of being the phoenix pirates under puzzle the accino family meanwhile pledges to collect the straw hats heads  
trapped by moving icebergs the straw hats try to figure a way out avoiding numerous dangers as the assassins draw closer the phoenix pirate puzzle awakes after choppers treatment only to reveal some harsh realities on the awaiting crew the thousand sunny is trapped by ice by three of the assassins however it escapes using the coup de burst zoro as usual is lost after severing a blocking iceberg in half and in an iceberg attack the rope attached to the phoenix pirate ship is severed leaving behind luffy and chopper their pirate flag is then stolen by a little girls flying fish  
using the shark submarine nami and franky find out that penguins are moving the icebergs afterwards they are attacked by hockera usopp and sanji are knocked off the sunny by an iceberg and encounter sarco and albelle luffy and chopper along with the rest of the phoenix pirates are attacked by blindo and lil the little girl appears before robin back on the sunny finally zoro stumbles upon lovely land the accino familys hq the fight between the accino family and the straw hats begin  
the fights continue luffy distracted due to the lost flag has initial trouble with blindo but the phoenix pirates help capture him usopp has marginal success against albelle but is hampered by the angered sarco franky meanwhile manages to beat hockera at the cost of his remaining cola but ends up iced up inside the sub along with nami lil accepts robins request to be led to lovely land where zoro is aimlessly wandering inside it

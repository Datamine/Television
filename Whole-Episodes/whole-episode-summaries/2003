this episode originally aired after super bowl xxxvii on abc 
despite earning critical acclaim from usa today and attracting the largest audience of the series with 174 million viewers this episode retained just 19 percent of the super bowl xxxvii audience and has the dubious distinction of earning the lowest overall ratings for a program airing after a super bowl since at least 1987 and the lowest rating ever 83 rating in the age 18-49 demographic for a post-super bowl program much of this can be attributed to the fact that the episode didnt air until 11 pm on the east coast which also meant it was not eligible for the weeks list of top primetime shows ranked by nielsen media research and thus the episodes viewership numbers were not factored in the series overall 2002-2003 season average

kenny’s divorce has been made final and he is feeling depressed frasier suggests he seek professional help and is eventually persuaded to take on the job himself he actually finds it thrilling to return to private practice however after one evening out drinking at mcginty’s with martin kenny is already feeling better and wants to give up the therapy much to frasier’s dismay meanwhile niles and daphne have started yoga and niles is somewhat dispirited to discover that his wife is outperforming him 
while shopping for ingredients for an at-home soirée frasier and niles are outraged by the price of beluga caviar their protests are overheard by a rather shady-looking individual who claims to them that the russian mafia control the market and keep the prices up he also says he can supply high-quality caviar at more reasonable prices and after tasting one sample the brothers are more than convinced the guests at their party are also very impressed and all sorts of social opportunities start opening up for frasier and niles in return for supplying the caviar roz helps with the transactions in return for a share and becomes gradually fixated to the point of addiction however their supplier becomes worried that too many orders draw attention and stops making deliveries determined not to lose their social advantages the cranes decide to track down the caspian queen the russian ship which brought the caviar to the usa unfortunately customs are on the same trail meanwhile martin has been overpaid by a cash machine and daphne insists that he return the extra money to the bank and clear his conscience but they find the process surprisingly complicated 
a team of volunteers from kacl have helped build a house for the charity “housing for humanity” and although frasier’s contributions were modest he is still proud of them in fact he sees it as his right to call round the house several times once the grant family has moved in to advise them on how to decorate the place at first they treat this as an honour but it quickly becomes a conflict between their very different tastes and roz decides to intervene after a heated argument daphne’s mother has started working at café nervosa in an attempt to make her daughter feel guilty but daphne is not prepared to be manipulated martin and eddie become a sensational safety act at a local primary school at least until martin is taken ill and niles is forced to stand in at the last minute 
frasier has hired an old friend from his oxford days avery mcmanus john hannah as his accountant and his spending habits are already causing some concern following a difficult meeting frasier seeks sanctuary in café nervosa with niles only to discover that they now have a loud folk singer played by elvis costello playing afternoons there frasier voices his objections but ends up crossing the establishment owner maureen nervosa and in the end feels compelled to leave he and niles spend some time trying unsuccessfully to find an alternative regular café during his search he is shocked to discover julia wilcox a condescending co-worker from kacl in the arms of his accountant knowing that avery is married frasier is faced with an ethical dilemma as to whether he should tell julia this fact niles meanwhile is unable to keep away from nervosa 
frasier encounters dr phil mcgraw whom he used to know years previously unfortunately frasier’s one enduring memory is that dr phil won 200 from him in a card game everyone else especially roz admires him greatly for his television broadcasts frasier also makes the astonishing discovery that his former agent bebe glazer is now working for dr phil she however now has plans for persuading frasier to return as her client and will use any methods at her disposal to achieve her aim 
frasier and his family receive a visit from dr leland barton david ogden stiers his late mother’s research assistant now settled in paris they find him sophisticated and erudite with an interest in sherry and the arts – in short surprisingly similar to frasier and niles roz even observes that they have some similar mannerisms and when leland confides in her how close he was to their mother she cannot help considering the possibility that the similarities are more than just a coincidence martin makes some similar observations and begins to feel unsettled by the thought niles and daphne are also thinking about parenting and although there are no children on the way yet niles is keen to get a place in advance at a decent kindergarten the problem is that they have to put a name on the form 
julia felicity huffman has finished her affair with frasier’s accountant avery and is vacillating between depression and anger frasier offers his support even despite her determination to break into avery’s office and cause chaos during this escapade they are forced to hide in a closet to avoid detection and frasier is surprised when julia kisses him she insists it was to keep him quiet but he believes there must be more to it and spends days trying to persuade julia to talk it over with him he also has to come to terms with the possibility that roz may be leaving kacl as she has been offered a job at another radio station as a program director she in turn is worried because it appears she may have encountered the interviewer before romantically meanwhile niles has discovered an unexpected enthusiasm for firearms 
roz is preparing to leave kacl to take a job as program director at another station noel has been delegated as her replacement which is not a decision in which frasier has much confidence the station organises a leaving party for roz at which she becomes so emotional that she changes her mind and decides to stay after all however frasier is now forming a new relationship with julia which makes roz very uncomfortable and though she claims this is just because it is a mismatch the reasoning is not convincing to julia meanwhile niles and daphne are dreaming of starting their own family but daphne is determined to get rid of her mother before they do 


roz hates her new job at kpxy so much that she abandons it after one day she walks back into kacl and disposes of frasier’s new wheelchair-bound producer after recovering from the initial shock of seeing roz back frasier demands to know her reasons for returning but without success he consults niles firmly convinced that roz has feelings for him and is also concerned because he frasier and julia are on the verge of taking their relationship to the next level niles however is having problems of his own he and daphne have decided to try for a baby when it is revealed that niles once made a contribution to a sperm bank during college with daphne worried that niles may already have a child niles goes to the sperm bank to make enquiries only to be told that his sample was discarded due to low motility niles then starts taking all measures in order to improve motility he eventually decides to tell daphne and the two anticipate a difficult time conceiving but in the end the worrying was for nothing as it turns out that daphne is already pregnant 
daphne is pregnant and she and niles are keen to make an official announcement to the family over dinner rather than tell frasier informally and have the news broadcast for them meanwhile frasier’s relationship with julia has run into difficulty and following a conversation with his brother frasier decides to “commit to commitment” and resolve the problems rather than run away from them his reconciliation with julia ends up coinciding with niles and daphne’s announcement dinner which they are compelled to relocate to frasier’s place after their oven breaks down they agree to let julia stay for dinner and even though they find her frankness and general conduct offensive frasier is reluctant to find fault because of his renewed commitment eventually julia mocks frasiers hand towels and he breaks up with her in disgust in the end frasier apologises for allowing julia to ruin the evening and the family celebrate niles and daphnes happy news 
frasier thinks that rozs new boyfriend is gay he follows him into a gay bar which makes everyone think that frasier is gay alistair burke a high-profile gay opera director patrick stewart then becomes interested in frasier who may be too enamoured with the perks of a power-couple relationship to set alistair straight 
while out shopping for a couch frasier and niles encounter ronee lawrence wendie malick a former babysitter from years ago who turned down frasier’s affections and used to tell niles scary bedtime stories they learn that she is now working as a singer and pianist at a local hotel having established also that she is divorced frasier takes the opportunity of inviting her round to his house for cocktails that evening martin is delighted to see ronee and soon both he and frasier are flirting with her they both pursue her to the wellington hotel to see her play and continue competing for her attention frasier persuades her to duet with him but is disappointed when she sings directly to martin – and his mood is reflected in his playing as ronee and martin grow closer frasier goes through a spell of depression and since he is due to start private psychiatry again soon niles becomes worried 
frasier seems to have become a lonely bachelor who spends his evenings eating vegetable soup and looking after a friend’s cat mr bottomsley dining out with the family is also now an embarrassment for him being between two couples niles and daphne and martin and ronee roz offers to set him up with a friend of hers a divorcée who works in insurance saying she would be the perfect “placeholder” frasier is not keen but desperate not to turn into a solitary old man agrees to a date with ann played by julia sweeney halfway through what he finds an insufferably dull meal kenny appears with his attractive cousin liz wright krista allen who works in the arts and offers frasier a way out all he has to do is get rid of his date 
martin’s relationship with ronee seems to be going well although frasier does not appreciate being woken up in the morning by ronee’s musical stylings then quite accidentally frasier overhears ronee arranging a date with another man in a phonecall he is at first not sure whether to tell martin or not but in the end is unable to stop himself martin’s reaction is to chastise him for eavesdropping despite his protestations that it was accidental later when martin asks ronee to go with him to a doo-wop concert and she claims to have made plans he elicits the truth from her and she tells him she was not under the impression their relationship was exclusive this leads martin to pretend he also has another woman called sheila a rôle that roz finds herself cast in before long frasier overhears this conversation too and suddenly finds this happening to him rather frequently 
frasier makes a return to practicing private psychiatry and although he is most excited his first day turns into a sequence of disasters niles who is doing his best to cope with a pregnant and hormonal daphne receives an unexpected phonecall from a hysterical maris he agrees to meet her for lunch and learns that she has problems with a new boyfriend an argentine polo player who has a violent temper niles advises maris to leave him and is worried how daphne will react to hearing about the meeting both frasier and martin advise him to keep it to himself so when daphne starts asking questions about lunch niles pretends to be organizing a surprise baby shower for her however the deception becomes progressively more difficult to sustain 
maris has been arrested for the murder of her argentine boyfriend and the police have called in niles for questioning it soon becomes apparent that the murder weapon was an antique crossbow belonging to niles which he had lent to maris for an artistic re-enactment even though niles emerges unscathed from the police interview he and daphne have to endure several days of persecution by the press and sleep deprivation not to mention endless phonecalls from maris in prison the situation becomes worse when frasier offers to make a television statement on niles’ behalf and once on camera makes a horrendous malapropism mistakenly saying his brother should be “executed” meaning to say “exonerated” all this time niles is dealing very calmly with the whole situation – almost too calmly in fact and frasier knows the dangers of repression things finally break down in café nervosa when niles suffers a nervous breakdown he undresses and ends up sitting at a table completely naked reading a newspaper roz defends niles keeping everyone in the restaurant from calling the police while frasier is able to get him to safety 
lilith is in town for a psychiatric conference and frasier reluctantly assumes his obligation to meet with her before he does so an interested colleague of liliths sets him up on a blind date with her not knowing who he really is meanwhile martins pistol accidentally discharges inside the apartment creating a trail of destruction that he daphne and niles try to hide from frasier 
since maris murder case appeared in the news niles has acquired a certain celebrity status in seattle socialising with figures like bill gates frasier cannot help being annoyed by this and he finds roz in a similar position she is receiving a visit from her perfect married sister denise frasier hopes to regain some notoriety when he is nominated twice for the seattle broadcasting awards the seabees and kenny arranges for a news reporter to shadow him on the day of the ceremony unusually it takes place in the morning and in the absence of a date frasier asks denise to take the part just for presentation niles is also in attendance and the reporter is keen to ask him questions – although this turns out to be the least of frasiers problems 
it is christmas frasier has been asked to act in a commercial for the seattle tourist board and is more than a little interested in natalie who is arranging it he meets her in café nervosa but she also meets martin and eddie and seeing how cute eddie is decides that he should be in the video as well – much to frasiers chagrin he hopes the arrival of his son frederick will cheer him up but when he sees he is now a goth complete with new goth girlfriend andi and wants to spend all his time with her frasier is left a little shocked and somewhat downhearted niles sees fredericks goth choice as a phase and typical of a teenage rebellion prompting a discussion of what everyone did to rebel as a teenager with martin pointing out that niles had never rebelled even though in season 1 it is stated he was arrested for mooning president nixon this leads niles to take some drastic action he is going to get high on reefer frasier questions where he is going to get hold of some – answered when roz delivers niles a pot brownie niles car alarm goes off at that point and neither frasier or roz can stay so roz gives the brownies to martin who is just arriving in the café he tries to stop himself eating them as he is trying to cut down on junk food but cant help himself of course he does not know they are laced with cannabis but having eaten it buys a normal one to make sure niles doesnt know he has eaten the one destined for him niles therefore is none the wiser and eats his normal brownie still under the impression he will get high while frasier cannot believe his eyes when he finally sees the advert for the seattle tourist board – they have made eddie the star with frasier narrating what eddie is saying undaunted he leaves to go out on a date with natalie after niles arrives high on his pot brownie martin arrives soon after and niles believes that the crazy way his father begins acting is just the pot kicking in it takes a sober frasier to point out that its their father that is high claiming to martin youre stoned off your ass which leaves niles somewhat deflated until his brother points out that he did get their cop father high meanwhile frasier is a bit depressed as his date natalie left him midway through the date to meet another man freddie also experiences the same thing and the similarity in incidents help father and son to bond again 
the kacl team has a weight loss competition with a competing radio station the whole team pigs out just before the first weigh-in just in order to bloat the original numbers frasier however refuses to participate in such an act of “blatant unsportsmanship” in the episode’s sub-plot a pigeon flies into frasier’s glass window niles and martin take it upon themselves to nurse it back to health at the initial weigh-in frasier recognizes one of his “mortal enemies” from his high school days participating on the opposing team the two make a bet on the outcome of the winner with frasier’s dignity pitted up against a new chess set the kacl team undergoes increasingly extreme measures to lose weight including a complete fast 24 hours before the final weigh-in furthermore frasier has converted his bathroom into a steam room and invites the entire kacl team to use it to shed some more weight before the final weigh-in in conclusion of the sub-plot eddie takes the pigeon out of the box and eats it unbeknown to frasier shortly afterwards kenny daly says he needs to get a glass of water from the kitchen suspicious of his intentions the kacl team suggest frasier monitor that he doesnt eat anything he then finds kenny eating something and feathers all round the pigeons box frasiers shocked cries bring the others martin then reveals it was eddie who ate the pigeonthis news makes everyone lose their appetites for the final few hours of the competition but at the final weigh-in the kacl team loses by a mere 2 ounces so roz cuts off her hair and kacl wins the competition 
martin discovers an envelope in the pocket of one of his jackets which contains a cheque for frasier’s home insurance renewal and should have been posted months previously realising this frasier makes a hasty call to the company and is horrified at the amount he would have to pay now to renew roz advises him to consult ann hodges whom frasier remembers from their disastrous date the placeholder he reluctantly agrees and invites her round to survey his home where she slips on a mayonnaise spillage in the kitchen and breaks her leg anxious to avoid a lawsuit when he has no insurance frasier decides to invite ann to stay at his place for a few days while she recovers – a decision he soon regrets meanwhile maris has been released on bail and is being kept under house arrest with an electronic tracking device on her wrist niles learns that she plans on auctioning some possessions to help pay legal costs she offers him the chance to look over them first so he seizes the opportunity to reclaim a “quasi-erotic” portrait of himself as pan little does he realise that he is about to act as a decoy in her escape plan 
frasier’s radio show is receiving very few calls and niles has been losing patients and arguing with daphne martin on the other hand is offered the chance to spend the weekend at a house in the mountains with ronee courtesy of her boss they inadvertently end up inviting frasier niles and daphne to join them and seeing the state those three are in martin and ronee feel compelled not to let them down they all go to the house determined to have a relaxing time but once there frasier has a nightmare in which he has murdered niles and is married to daphne soon afterwards niles has a nightmare about the stresses of being a father and then daphne also has one in which she puts on copious weight after childbirth and niles sleeps with other women the three of them all end up in the kitchen in the middle of the night arguing and it falls to martin to sort them out 
roz is disappointed when she is unable to get alice tickets to a concert by childrens performer nanette guzman aka nanny g after his family reveals that he used to be married to her frasier agrees to help roz secure tickets he accompanies roz and alice to a bookstore appearance and continually drops hints to nanny g about the fact that he is single she doesnt seem interested however she soon has everyone in the store cover their eyes as part of a song she gooses frasier and kisses him passionately they plan a rendezvous at his apartment much to his surprise nanny g shows up with her producer donald who is also her husband she claims that the marriage is only a business arrangement and laments how frustrated she is with her life she makes several passes at frasier and asks him to meet up with her after her concert the next day although he is in the midst of a dry spell and desperately wants to go through with it he realizes it is wrong he stops by before the show to share his decision and nanny g asks him to go down to the prop room to talk she seduces frasier and he takes off his clothes and jumps into the prop bed with her only to have it rise to the stage as the show begins meanwhile niles buys an expensive sweater breaking a promise to daphne to be frugal and save money for their childs college fund daphne who believes the sweater is from gap quickly proceeds to ruin it leaving niles frustrated but with no recourse 
frasier is becoming fed up with his father playing tricks on him and mocking the effeminate scream that his pranks provoke it happens that frasier is treating a patient who has the rare condition of coulrophobia – fear of clowns part of the treatment he has planned is to dress up as a clown so he has a very comprehensive costume in a bid for vengeance on his father frasier disguises himself as a clown which martin hates after frasier jumps out at him wearing the outfit martin has a heart attack and is hospitalized this spurs martin to propose to ronee while recovering 
frasier is pacing up and down his apartment while a storm goes on outside niles arrives annoyed at being called away from the “gifted infants’ toy expo” and frasier confesses that he has committed a crime punishable by us law there then follows a flashback while he explains frasier has been having a bad day during his radio show he came down with a coughing fit and roz had to advise his kleptomaniac caller babette after which she claimed he had been dispensing the same advice for ten years he was later turned down by an attractive woman who had parked her car in his space and cornered at his front door by an elderly neighbour who said she could set her watch by his routine he also did not appreciate coming home to two happy couples – niles and daphne and martin and ronee – while he himself is still single calling round to change a light bulb for his neighbour he learned that even she is still dating at the age of 83 at this point in the story niles learns of frasier’s crime he surreptitiously stole an item from one of her shelves just for the thrill however now he is plagued by guilt and wants niles’ help in returning the item in case he feels the urge to steal again neither of them realises the importance of the stolen object 
frasier stumbles upon a matchmaking service on the way to his office and takes some time explaining to the woman at the door that he is there by mistake however this is followed by an encounter with a former girlfriend in the elevator and since charlotte the matchmaking agent played by laura linney witnesses this frasier decides to come quietly after parting with 10 000 he is sent on a series of disastrous dates and eventually loses patience and demands his money back it is then that he discovers the business and its agent are not what they seem niles and daphne have been socialising with another couple expecting a child brad and cindy this couple talk at length about all their plans for the birth what to do with the placenta and so forth and brad even seems to be experiencing a sympathetic pregnancy determined not to be outdone niles and daphne decide to hire a doula for their birth 
martin is soon to meet ronee’s mother again and given that she is opposed to pre-marital sex they have to pretend that they are not practising it frasier is distracted constantly by thoughts of charlotte the matchmaking agent with whom he had dinner the other night and who is already in a relationship niles agrees with him that his feelings could be transference but after seeing frasier when he talks to charlotte roz dismisses that theory instantly she decides to help frasier out by taking him to a bar where he meets a flirtatious woman called kim they both go back to his place but receive several interruptions the last of which is by charlotte who has just had an argument with her boyfriend and wished to be consoled by frasier meanwhile niles has developed an uncharacteristic taste for fast food and it is driving daphne to distraction 
frasier plans to work his charms on charlotte to tempt her away from frank aaron eckhart so he invites her for what she assumes to be a working dinner at a high-quality restaurant for him frank also turns up this becomes the first of several occasions on which frasier ends up spending time with charlotte and frank and at no point does frank suspect that his intentions are less than honourable on the contrary he thinks of frasier as a real friend there is however tension between him and charlotte and matters come to a head one evening when frasier has cooked dinner for charlotte and frank turns up unannounced the couple have an argument and frank walks out leaving frasier with just the opportunity he was hoping for martin plans to give ronee her engagement ring but when daphne and roz discover that it is the same ring he planned to give to sherry they insist that he sell it and buy one especially for ronee this he does and the new ring is very impressive but its origins are somewhat unexpected 
having spent the night with charlotte frasier is very pleased with himself however his good mood disappears when while driving her to the station to catch a train to portland she tells him that in three weeks she will be moving back home to chicago neither wants a long-distance relationship so they are compelled to consider breaking up before things get more serious in the midst of this conversation they miss the train so frasier drives to the next station owing to his over-careful driving they miss it again and then the car breaks down on the way to the next station leaving them stranded in the middle of nowhere fortunately they find the house of an experienced car mechanic and his family but they turn out to be rather eccentric meanwhile in frasier’s absence niles is left to organize the entertainment for martin’s bachelor party and roz has found him a stripper for niles that she is coming round to be interviewed on the same day as daphne’s new nanny while the stripper is mistaken for martin’s new physiotherapist 
 
frasier chips an old earthenware crock pot while preparing dinner and is about to throw it away when he pauses and remembers the dinners associated with the item going back in time until finally remembering the first dinner he had made for his father niles daphne and roz the show invented new scenes from previous seasons with the cast wearing the hairstyles clothes and vocal and semiotic mannerisms from those previous seasons in some cases wearing wigs 
 
 
after the flashbacks frasier repairs the crock pot warmly places flowers in it and gives it an honored place on the dinner table as the gang arrives when he fills it with water the pot immediately begins to leak from all the cracks 
while on a plane frasier meets a woman named anne they engage in conversation and in flashback frasier recalls the events preceding his plane ride frasier and niles volunteer to put together a quick wedding for martin and ronee when the venue is only available for one day meanwhile frasier says farewell to charlotte as she departs for chicago the wedding ceremony gets off to a rocky start when the guests are stranded outside in the heat and things get worse when eddie swallows one of the rings daphne and niles rush him to a nearby veterinarian and while there daphne goes into labor and gives birth to her and niles first son whom they name david ronee and martin get married at the vet clinic frasiers agent bebe glazer gets him an offer to do a television show in san francisco which frasier initially declines but after realizing that he wants to start a new chapter in his life he accepts 
a case of communication breakdowns lead martin ronee roz daphne and niles to believe that frasier is dying an error given more substantial backing when he begins giving them each some of his most prized possessions and when a doctor phones and leaves a message saying that frasiers results werent good the misunderstanding is soon cleared up and the family celebrates frasiers new opportunity in san francisco before he leaves frasier and his family share a tearful farewell and frasier explains to him that with martin and ronee newly-weds and daphne and niles newborn david and roz getting the job of station manager at kacl they each have begun a new chapter in their lives and that he wants that for himself now he then goes on to recite tennysons ulysses which flows into him saying it in his last show frasier records his last show with the people who work at kacl and his family watching him his final words on his talk show are for 11 years you have heard me say im listening well you were listening too and for that im eternally gratefulgoodnight seattle and hangs up his headphones before the episode flashes back to the plane where frasier has just finished relaying his story to anne in a final twist the plane touches down not in san francisco but in chicago frasier turns to anne and says wish me luck

once freed from zabuzas water prison jutsu kakashi easily defeats enemy by using his sharingan to replicate many of zabuzas water-based attacks while messing with his head at the last second zabuza is seemingly killed by a young masked hunter ninja from the hidden mist village naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave team 7 so much trouble but kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than naruto yet stronger than himself the hunter-nin leaves with zabuzas body and kakashi then collapses from fatigue as a result of using his sharingan for too long  
brought to tazunas home to recover from his fight with zabuza naruto meeting the bridge builders grandson inari kakashi awakens while realizing that were numerous inconsistencies with zabuzas death and the actions of the masked youth not destroying the body on the spot expecting that they would face zabuza again kakashi decides to take team 7 to the woods to teach them chakra control by having them walk up a tree by infusing chakra into their feet while sakura got it on the first try both naruto and sasuke had to attempt it numerous times with kakashi seeing naruto asking sakura for advice elsewhere revealed to be zabuzas follower the masked youth known as haku tends to zabuzas wounds as the swordsman intends to settle things with kakashi once fully healed within a weeks time

taking a nap after training in the woods naruto is waked up by who he thought was a girl eventually learning that the person actually a boy but aware that he is the masked youth haku naruto gets into an exchange of ideals and morals before the two part ways once found by sasuke naruto resumes his tree climbing practice into the evening until he and sasuke finally make it to the top of their respective trees naruto and sasuke return triumphantly to tazunas home with naruto cheerful yet completely drained from the effort inari is disturbed at the sight of naruto thinking about kaiza and as he gets into a heated dispute with naruto who leaves while calling him a coward later that night kakashi tells a despondent inari that naruto understands the boys pain from his own hardships the next morning deciding to let naruto sleep in kakashi sasuke and sakura escort tazuna to work upon arriving at the bridge they find tazunas workers unconscious with zabuza and a masked haku revealing themselves  
at tazunas house two of gatos thugs arrive to kidnap tsunami inari musters his courage in an attempt to stop them but is saved when naruto defeats them before leaving to join the others at the bridge naruto apologizes to inari for calling him a coward and acknowledges his bravery on the bridge as kakashi engages zabuza sasukes newly gained speed gives him an advantage against haku before the masked ninja traps him in his personal jutsu crystal ice mirrors

naruto and sasuke both attempt to destroy the ice mirrors their respective shadow clone and fire ball jutsus having no effect realizing that hakus crystal ice mirrors are actually an ice-style kekkei genkai a bloodline trait kakashi decides to use his sharingan to quickly end his fight with zabuza however as haku told him what kakashis methods during their last fight zabuza has the advantage as he uses his hidden mist jutsu to counter kakashis sharingan and force the ninja to ponder his opponents next move kakashi finally realizes that zabuza will strike at tazuna and sakura and rushes to intercept as zabuza as lands a strike on kakashi from behind with his kubikiribōchō sword

though he agrees to kill haku naruto instead witnesses haku sacrificing himself to protect zabuza from kakashis lightning blade unfazed by his apprentices sacrifice zabuza continues attacking kakashi while tazuna accompanies sakura to sasukes body eventually kakashi manages to disable zabuzas arms but before the battle can end gato arrives with his men with the intent to kill everyone present with zabuza included meanwhile disappointed in the villagers are attempts to rally their support for the bridge inari sets out alone but finds a crowd waiting for him outside

as everyone takes their seat ibiki explains that the first phase of the exam will be a written test where the team with the most points continues to the next phase ibikis assistants line the sides of the room to observe the genin to make sure they do not cheat with team removed from the room if one member is caught cheating five times with the exception of naruto and sakura sasuke and everyone realize that the real test is to subtly cheat through their unique skills while sakura is able to answer the questions naruto is the opposite as he feels he must place all his faith in the final question which will be given fifteen minutes before the tests end  
forty-five minutes into the written portion of the chūnin exams ibiki announces that it is time for the tenth and final question but he ominously states that while their team would fail the exam if they do not take it failure to answer it correctly would result in the participant being barred from future chunin exams fretting over the turn of events naruto refuses to accept give in to fear with his outburst putting the minds of those remaining at ease seeing no one else leaving ibiki reveals that the first nine were to their skills in intel gathering while the final question was to test their resolve passing ibikis test the proctor amused to find naruto passed his test without answering any question the remaining genin meet their next instructor anko mitarashi the next day at the sight of the second phase of the exam the forest of death  
the episode is an anime-exclusive episode for konohamaru and his classmates news report starring the chuunin in training before the second exam can begin konohamaru and his friends pull the members of team 7 aside for interviews where they retell the storyline to this point they discuss the hokages the rogue ninja etc  
anko briefs the candidates on their goal for the second portion of the exam that each team is given one of two scrolls a heaven scroll and an earth scroll each teams must take an opposing teams opposing scroll and reach the tower in the center of the forest to continue after being handed their scroll team 7 enters the forest of death the same time as the other genin teams  
a few minutes after entering the forest of death naruto leaves the team to relieve himself but he is knocked out by a genin from the hidden rain village who assumes his form to infiltrate team 7 luckily seeing through the disguise sasuke drives away the attacking rain genin while he and his team mates go over a password to identify themselves in such a situation naruto is separated from the others by a powerful gust of wind before being swallowed by a giant snake in the meantime sasuke and sakura are disabled by a grass ninja named shiore before they even fight sasuke and sakura have visions of their own deaths upon looking into shiores eyes paralyzing them with fear regaining his composure sasuke flees with sakura as shiore pursues luckily having managed to kill the snake naruto arrives in time to save both of them  
despite narutos timely appearance sasuke offers shiore the scroll in exchange for their lives sasuke then throws the scroll to the shiore but naruto intercepts it naruto punches sasuke during his attempt to convince him into giving the scroll up naruto accusses sasuke of being an impostor as the sasuke he knew would never be so weak and cowardly shiore summons a giant snake and engages naruto who uses the nine tails chakra to fight eventually learning his opponent is the host of the nine tails shiore seals narutos ability to access the monsters power as narutos unconscious body is saved by sakura pinning it to a tree with a kunai in mid air sasuke manages to muster the courage from narutos words to fight meanwhile anko learns of three faceless corpses found near the exams one of them revealed to be shiore and recognizes that jutsu used to remove their faces  
after a protracted battle with the mysterious ninja posing as shiore sasuke traps the ninja and creates a new jutsu on the spot in the heat of battle to incinerate his attack however the ninja is still alive with his face partially melted off to reveal part of the figures true face after extending his neck to inflict sasuke with a mark the ninja introduces himself as orochimaru burning the scroll he possessed orochimaru leaves while promising sasuke that he will look for him anko eventually finds orochimaru her former teacher and unsuccessfully tries to kill him while learning that his target was sasuke and that any interference in the chunin exams to remove the youth from the proceedings will end terribly for the hidden leaf village  
after the ordeal with orochimaru sakura managed to move her team mates under a tree to tend to their wounds through out the night sakura is unaware that her team are being watched by team dosu who placed an explosive tag on a squirrel that sakura wards off without knowledge of it being made a bomb soon after the sound genin makes their presence known as they reveal their intent to kill sasuke while dealing with the numerous traps that sakura prep to defend her team mates luckily having been guided by the squirrel after saving it lee arrives to protect saura with his last breath as the battle ensued lee uses the front lotus on dosu before the impact is cushioned by zaku abumi and lee knocked out  
with her team mates and lee all unconscious sakura is forced to fight on her own before one of the sound genin kin tsuchi grabs the girl by her hair and proceeds to give her a bloody beating this causes sakura to remember her past with her own rival ino yamanaka and remembers why she grew her hair so long she then focuses on being a strong ninja rather than just an attractive one cutting her hair to free herself from kins grasp before attacking zaku moved by sakuras determination ino and the rest of team 10 come to sakuras aid  
team 10 battles team dosu each using their unique techniques to battle however though ino uses her mind-transfer jutsu on kin the sound genin regain the advantage before sasuke suddenly awakens empowered by orochimarus curse mark sasuke is rendered a cruel and sadistic monster as he easily defeats zaku while crippling his arm terrified by sasukes extremely cruel brutality sakura stops him before he can kill and instruct fatality on either of the sound genin deciding they stand no chance dosu leaves a scroll so he and his team can retreat without further harm  
as team 7 team 10 and team guy recover team 8 witnesses gaara mercilessly kill a team of rain genin although gaara prepares to turn his attention to team 8 his siblings persuade him to leave them alone gaaras team beats the previous record for getting to the tower by a gigantic margin and none of them are even remotely injured  
kabuto separated from his team accompanies team 7 to the tower in the center of the forest along the way the group encounters a disorienting genjutsu set by the hidden rain gennin group whose member sasuke had earlier defeated by the time they realize that they are not getting any closer to the center of the forest they are attacked by a number of clones  


the team realizes they are in another genjutsu in order to draw out the assailants naruto disguises several of his shadow clones as his teammates and fights the enemy clones all night when the rain genin believe that team 7 exhausted from combat kabuto sakura and sasuke corner them after a brief struggle naruto knocks out the enemies and takes their scroll at which point they head to the tower and meet with kabutos team unknown to team 7 kabuto submits all of the data he gathered on them to orochimaru  
team 7 opens its scrolls inside the tower summoning iruka to inform them that they made it in time he observes their growth then allows them to enter the main room where they meet with the other passing teams team 10 team 8 team guy the sand siblings kabutos team and team dosu hiruzen briefly speaks about what the exams are all about before entrusting hayate gekko to oversee the matches  
hayate reveals that an unusually large number of genin got through the second stage of the exam a series of one-on-one preliminary matches will be held to reduce the number of people meaning that there will be a tournament for the next exam eliminating the loser and promoting the victor kabuto drops out immediately upon the notice blaming his withdrawal on an injury sustained from an earlier part of the test the preliminary matches are randomized with a machine and the dials end at sasuke vs yoroi beginning with sasuke uchiha versus yoroi akado but before sasuke heads into battle sakura tries to stop him saying that he will lose and get hurt severely if he doesnt use any chakra because it will surely awaken the cursed seals power  
sasuke fights yoroi but is handicapped by his inability to use chakra due to the danger of activating the cursed seal yorois ability to absorb chakra gives him an advantage but sasuke in the heat of battle invents a new signature jutsu on the spot that can only be used by him and uses a new taijutsu technique the lions barrage a jutsu that consists of sasuke launching his opponent in to the air usually with a kick on the neck sasuke tricks his opponent with a pretend attack and does a real one sasuke instructs three more blows with lion rage and then kicks his opponent down and for the finishing blow he does a frontflip kick down to the ground sasuke after using the barrage he even still manages to suppress his cursed seal in the process and sasuke wins his exam match kakashi takes him to an isolated location to hinder the cursed seal only to be confronted by orochimaru as he finishes back at the tower shino aburame and zaku abumi begin the next match  
kakashi threatens to kill orochimaru a threat that orochimaru takes lightly despite this orochimaru leaves with kakashi terrified at his foolishness meanwhile shino and zaku abumi continue their match with shino ultimately winning his match through the use of his destruction bugs leaving kankuro and misumi tsurugi to fight next  
kankuro easily wins his battle against misumi by tricking him into attacking karasu kankuros puppet in retaliation karasu snaps misumis neck though he survives due to his ability to contort himself the fourth match is between sakura haruno vs ino yamanaka after the two exchange insults they have flash backs from when they were kids they then decide to take the battle seriously  
sakura and ino are evenly matched they both use illusion clone jutsu chakra string jutsu and others finally ino tries a desperate move her mind body switch technique she succeeds and takes control over sakuras body as she prepares to force sakura to forfeit naruto believing in sakura as her teammate and cheers sakura on and like a voice of reason or a spiritual hand narutos cheering voice awakens sakura and inadvertently awakens her inner sakura who forces ino out of her body in a brutal and physical force both drained of their chakra ino and sakura decide to end the battle with a giant final cha blow they dash towards each other with all theyre power inserted into one fist each the rivals both at the same with a punch on their both of their faces each and knock each other out resulting in a double knockout tie and eliminating both from the finals  
the next match is between temari and tenten tentens weapon summonings are negated by temaris wind-based attacks and she is defeated shikamaru nara and kin tsuchi are chosen for the next match although kin ensnares shikamaru in a genjutsu he captures her in his shadow imitation technique he forces her to knock herself unconscious the next combatants are randomized putting everyone into awaiting excitements and in the end are revealed to be naruto and kiba inuzuka  
kiba quickly embarrasses naruto by sending him tumbling to the ground with one intense blow but he soon discovers that naruto will not be taken down so easily kiba and his dog continue to prove too much for naruto he uses his superior strength and speed to dominate the match consuming special military pills that enhance their chakra kiba and akamaru use a combination of their speed and special signature jutsu to overwhelm naruto  
as the battle continues naruto manages to trick kiba into knocking akamaru out despite this naruto is still at a disadvantage due to kibas pill-enhanced chakra as well as his superior strength and speed kiba proves to be too fast for naruto to the point that naruto doesnt even have time to perform any jutsu using his speed to get behind naruto kiba is about to land a finishing blow before he can make contact however naruto unintentionally stops kiba in his tracks by farting in his face due to kibas special clan abilities his sense of smell is 1000 times greater than that of a normal person making the fart 1000 times worse taking advantaged of a disabled kiba naruto then attacks and defeats kiba with a lethal combination attack of his shadow clones  
the next match is hinata hyuga against neji hyuga her cousin from the branch house of the hyuga clan neji intimidates and berates his cousin and she seems ready to forfeit tired of his taunts naruto cheers hinata on giving her the strength to fight back hinata and neji fight each other using gentle fist style which uses bursts of chakra to damage the opponents internal organs  
neji reveals that he had been toying with hinata and he disables her ability to use chakra with the gentle fist style hinata inspired by naruto refuses to give up she tells neji that she believes that he is suffering more from fighting his destiny angered neji attempts a fatal blow but four observing jonin halt him hinata collapses into cardiac arrest shortly after and naruto vows to avenge her  
the next set of matchups is rock lee against gaara at first lees strong fist taijutsu is ineffective against gaaras wall of sand that automatically rises to protect him lee then removes the heavy leg weights he was wearing drastically increasing his speed and allowing him to bypass gaaras defense lee then uses his primary lotus but only succeeds in destroying a clone made of sand  
gaara reappears and attacks lee who is weakened from using his primary lotus again lee recovers by opening the second gate shocking the jonin observers in the audience he then proceeds to open the third and fourth gates shocking gaara  
lees increased speed overwhelms gaaras sand defenses lee opens the fifth gate and uses his most powerful attack hidden lotus lees power accuracy strength and speed increase outstandingly allowing lee to inflict extreme injuries on garra with a 5th gate barrage of his unfortunately for lee gaara survives by softening his fall with sand and uses his sand coffin to crush lees left arm and leg gaara moves his sand to finish lee but guy blocks the final attack lee though unconscious due to the pain and covered in blood rises to continue the battle his desire to win fueling his broken body at the end of the match rock lee is crippled to the extent that he is unable to fight again guy regrets teaching lee such dangerous techniques but vacates the ring for the final match between choji akimichi and dosu kinuta  
despite having formulated a strategy beforehand choji quickly loses to dosu concluding the preliminaries the nine qualifying genin are assigned opponents and they are all allowed to leave for a month of training before the finals elsewhere kabuto prepares to kidnap sasuke under orochimarus orders but he is stopped by kakashi and is forced to retreat naruto later meets with kakashi in hopes of training with him but is given ebisu as a replacement  
naruto reluctantly agrees to train under ebisu and ebisu tries to teach naruto how to walk on water as naruto practices ebisu catches an old man later revealed to be jiraiya spying on a womens bathhouse as ebisu rushes to apprehend him jiraiya knocks him out with a single hit leaving naruto without a tutor  
after jiraiya knocks out ebisu naruto is left without a tutor naruto manages to convince jiraiya to tutor him by using the sexy technique while jiraiya oversees narutos training he quickly realizes that naruto is the container of the nine-tails jiraiya unlocks the seal that orochimaru had placed on naruto in the forest and naruto quickly grasps the concept of walking on water afterwards jiraiya speaks with naruto about his two kinds of chakra  
that night dosu kinuta a finalist for the chunin exams attempts to assassinate gaara but gaara quickly kills him observing from a distance baki and kabuto yakushi confer about the planned invasion of konohagakure by sunagakure and otogakure their conversation is overheard by hayate gekko despite the latters swordsmanship and skills he is quickly dispatched by baki the next day naruto resumes his training with jiraiya he signs a scroll that will allow him to summon toads upon trying to summon a toad naruto only manages to summon a tadpole  
sakura visits the hospital to see sasuke but finds that sasuke has left while there sakura checks on rock lee despite the injuries that have taken away his hopes of becoming a ninja lee trains to regain his strength the training causes him too much pain and he passes out elsewhere the many finalists continue their training with naruto finally managing to summon a tadpole with hind-legs sasuke himself is off training with kakashi  
jiraiya realizes that narutos training is taking too long and decides to use drastic measures knowing that naruto can only tap into the foxs chakra during life-or-death situations jiraiya takes naruto to a local chasm and throws him in unable to stop himself from falling naruto enters his subconsciousness and converses with the fox asking for a donation of its strength the fox complies and naruto manages to summon gamabunta to stop his descent  
gamabunta is angry that he has been summoned in a pit and even angrier that naruto is sitting on top of his head although naruto informs gamabunta that he summoned him gamabunta does not believe him determined to prove himself naruto rides atop gamabuntas head until sunset while gamabunta tries to shake him off naruto falls shortly before sunset but he earns gamabuntas respect in the process gamabunta then takes naruto to the hospital to rest  
when naruto awakens he finds shikamaru nara sitting by his bed bringing him a basket of fruit the two locate gaara elsewhere in the hospital and halt his attempt to assassinate rock lee gaara explains that his reason for existing is to kill everyone and reveals that he like naruto was alone for much of his childhood hated and feared by others for being a host of a tailed beast gaara prepares to kill naruto and shikamaru as well but is stopped by the arrival of might guy lees sensei and leaves  
on the day of the finals naruto makes his way to the arena along the way he encounters and converses with hinata hyuga hinata reassures him of his talents removing any doubts he had about the finals naruto thanks hinata and goes on his way as he gets closer to the arena naruto meets konohamaru who tries to use a number of shortcuts to help naruto get to the arena faster the shortcuts end up being ineffective and time consuming as a result naruto makes it to the stadium late but can still enter  
naruto begins his match with neji hyuga who naruto promised to defeat a month earlier during the preliminaries since taijutsu proves ineffective naruto creates a large number of shadow clones though neji is able to destroy them all naruto creates more  
naruto creates more shadow clones and this time manages to sneak up on neji before he can land a blow neji uses a powerful defensive technique then follows up with another technique to block narutos chakra even though he can no longer fight naruto refuses to give up and berates neji over how he treated hinata neji then reveals the history of the hyuga clan and how his father was killed to save the life of his uncle he reaffirms his belief in the unchanging nature of ones destiny  
determined to prove neji wrong naruto draws on the demon foxs strength surprising many of the older ninja present with his ability to use the foxs chakra following an explosive clash between the two naruto manages to defeat neji through the use of a shadow clone as a decoy after telling neji to stop putting so much faith in fate naruto is declared the winner  
when neji is taken away to recover his uncle tries to tell neji the truth of his fathers death saying that he had given up his life to save his brother not a member of the main house neji is unbelieving but his reading his fathers final letter and seeing his uncle bowing for forgiveness causes him to realize the truth meanwhile the match between sasuke uchiha and gaara is postponed due to sasukes absence and the match between shino aburame and kankuro is set to start kankuro forfeits and the next combatants shikamaru and temari go down to the stadium  
though initially unwilling shikamaru fights temari because he refuses to lose to a girl shikamaru quickly studies the arena and its elements and comes up with a plan despite this temari has seen shikamarus primary attack in action and knows how it works shikamaru relies on strategy to defeat his opponent but it becomes evident that temari is a keen strategist too however shikamarus strategies are superior and enable him to capture temari with his jutsu but he forfeits as he has no chakra left to fight  
with sasuke and gaaras match needing to start the third hokage sets a time limit for sasuke to arrive sasuke arrives at the last minute with kakashi hatake meanwhile gaara kills a pair of ninjas who are attempting to fix the match on his way to enter the arena  
sasukes enhanced speed and taijutsu skills enable him to bypass gaaras sand-based defenses with ease as rock lee did previously determined to kill sasuke gaara retreats inside a sphere of sand and begins to transform  
to break through gaaras defense sasuke uses his new jutsu chidori with it sasuke is able to pierce gaaras shield stopping his transformation at that moment kabuto yakushi uses a genjutsu to put the audience to sleep signaling the start of the invasion of konoha  
revealing himself to have killed the fourth kazekage to get to him orochimaru takes hiruzen hostage as he has his personal bodyguards the sound four establish a barrier to so no one would interfere meanwhile invading sound and sand ninja infiltrate konoha and battles begin breaking out across the village kankuro and temari carry gaara from the village so that he can recover with sasuke in pursuit preoccupied with fending off the invading forces kakashi instructs sakura who had managed to repel the sleep-inducing genjutsu to wake naruto and shikamaru  
once naruto and shikamaru awaken the later actually faked sleep kakashi summons pakkun to assist them in tracking down sasuke meanwhile orochimaru begins his battle with hiruzen his mentor before becoming the third hokage both display powerful techniques in what the observing anbu describe as a kage-level battle during the battle orochimaru uses the reanimation jutsu to summon hiruzens deceased predecessors the second hokage tobirama senju who invented the reanimation jutsu and the first hokage hashirama senju the senju brothers apologize to their former student for what is about to happen as orochimaru forces them to fight hiruzen  
as naruto sakura shikamaru and pakkun pursue sasuke it soon becomes apparent that theyre being followed by a group of nine sound ninja shikamaru volunteers to stall them to buy the others time and falls back once the sound ninja get close enough shikamaru traps them with his shadow though he finds that he has only captured eight attempting to kill the eight shikamaru discovers the ninths location but lacks the chakra to trap him as his shadow recedes and the eight freed ninja prepare to kill shikamaru asuma sarutobi shikamarus sensei arrives and defeats all the sound ninja saving shikamaru  
the hokage battle begins with hashiramas wood style giving him and his brother the advantage on hiruzen as he summons enma to help him in the uneven fight as orochimaru brings out his kusanagi sword during the fight hiruzen learns that ninja brought back by the reanimation jutsu are immune to any normal form of attack and regenerate from any injury dealt on them at that time explaining his desire to become immortal to know every form of ninjutsu orochimaru decides to reveal the fruits of his labor by peeling away his face revealing the face of a face of a girl whose body he now occupies  
though temari tries to hold off sasuke so he brothers can escape sasuke easily dispatches her and resumes his chase at the hokage battle orochimaru reveals the nature of his transference ritual that allows him to transfer his being into the body of another every few years and that he intends to make sasuke his new vessel regretting not killing orochimaru when he had the chance the night his former student left the village hiruzen musters up his chakra and summons shadow clones for a last resort attack to rectify that mistake  
as the battles across konoha rage on the hiruzen has his clones use the reaper death seal on senjus brothers as the corpses used to reanimate the first two hokage are revealed to be kin and zaku hiruzen reveals that the reaper death seal is a double-edge attack that the fourth hokage used to defeat the nine-tails with his own soul as the price having given up two thirds of his own soul to seal the senju brothers within the reapers stomach hiruzen intends to feed what remained of his own soul and orochimarus soul to the monster as well however orochimaru has his kusanagi stabs the third hokage in the back meanwhile sasuke again catches up with gaara and kankuro prepares to hold sasuke off while gaara escapes with temari before they can begin shino aburame arrives to fight kankuro allowing sasuke to proceed  
leaving shino to deal with kankuro sasuke continues his pursuit of gaara kankuro attacks shino with his puppet using its many hidden weapons to catch shino by surprise shino is able to dodge the attacks through the use of his destruction bugs but eventually makes the mistake of inhaling some of the puppets poison gas as the battle goes on shino directs his bugs to kankuros location they consume his chakra once they get there causing kankuro to collapse the battle won shino also collapses due to kankuros poison sasuke catches up with gaara as shinos battle ends and the two resume their match  
gaara begins transforming into shukaku dramatically increasing his strength and speed sasuke uses his chidori to slice gaaras arm off but the pain only makes gaara more determined and excited to kill sasuke unable to use the chidori a third time sasuke is forced to use his cursed seal so that he can attack gaara again this fails to defeat him and sasuke collapses due to the use of the cursed seal as gaara prepares to inflict the finishing blow naruto repels the attack with a kick naruto sakura and pakkun arrive ready to help sasuke  
gaara tries to attack sasuke again but is covered by sakura who got in the way gaara pushes sakura out of the way while naruto grabs sasukes body and saves him gaara remembers his childhood with his maternal uncle yashamaru while yashamaru had for many years been the only person who seemed to care for him gaara is shocked to find yashamaru suddenly attacking him out of sheer hatred  
as gaara continues to reminisce about yashamaru he remembers yashamarus statement of his mothers death and his uncles suicide bombing though gaara survived the blast - thanks to the sand shield - he lost the only person who ever cared for him from that point on gaara came to love only himself and started to find purpose in killings others returning to the present gaara keeps his grip on sakura with his sand claw choking her to death gaara feeling deranged asks naruto to play a game with him saying that if he can beat him sakura will be set free determined to save sakura at all costs and win her affection an enraged naruto violently attacks gaara and they engage in battle  
naruto has been afraid of gaara ever since he met him but now narutos determination is awakened truly along with the will of fire rejuvenated naruto uses techniques from his ninja handbook scroll naruto unleashes new and improved naruto uzumaki barrage consisting of 2000 shadow clones naruto uzumaki 2k barrage 8 shadow clones kicked gaara into the air and all 2000 shadow clones punched gaara on every inch of his body before 2 shadow clones delivered a the final blow to the barrage naruto attempts a 2nd attack twice as powerful with kicks to fend off the attack gaara completes his transformation into a replica of the one tail gaara tries to crush naruto with his sand thinking of sakura and his friends naruto uses his own chakra to summon gamabunta gaara forces himself to sleep and allows shukaku to take over needing to get close to shukaku to wake gaara up naruto and gamabunta transform into a replica of the nine-tails to fight  
as the transformed gamabunta holds shukaku in place naruto awakens gaara tapping into the foxs power again naruto headbutts gaara and destroys shukakus form across konoha the villages ninja including the parents of many of the genin begin the counterattack of the invading forces at the site of his battle with orochimaru hiruzen realizes that he does not have enough strength left to fully seal orochimarus soul and instead opts to seal the part of his former pupils soul within his arms robbing orochimaru his ability to use jutsu hiruzens bids his enraged student a fond farewell as he dies reciting one last proverb at this time naruto and gaara jump at each other and naruto succeeds in throwing the winning blow  
critically damaged orochimaru calls off the invasion and flees the village with his forces in the forest naruto and gaara both lay on the ground devoid of chakra naruto sympathizes with gaara for his childhood but threatens to kill gaara if he should ever bring harm to his friends again realizing that narutos strength came from the desire to protect others gaara begins to reshape his view of the world as his siblings take him home and apologizes to temari and kankuro the next day the ninja of konoha mourn the deaths of those who died during the invasion especially hiruzen as they ponder the meaning of the third hokages sacrifice  
after hiruzens death revealed to be pupil alongside orochimaru jiraiya is approached by the villages elders as they offer him the position of fifth hokage he declines saying that his former team mate tsunade would be a much better candidate for the title jiraiya offers to find her for konoha and asks that he be allowed to take naruto with him meanwhile itachi uchiha and kisame hoshigaki enter konoha and are confronted by asuma sarutobi and kurenai yuhi itachi and kisame quickly gain the advantage in battle but kakashi comes to their rescue at the last moment  
kakashi and itachi exchange blows each being very proficient with the sharingan itachi neutralizes kakashi with his tsukuyomi as kakashi struggles to remain standing he asks itachi why hes returned to konoha itachi replies that theyre after naruto which kakashi elaborates as meaning they want the demon fox for their organization akatsuki angered that kakashi knows of their organization itachi instructs kisame to kill asuma and kurenai but to bring kakashi with him before kisame can do so might guy arrives itachi states he did not go to konoha to start a war so he and kisame left the battle  
guy asuma and kurenai take an unconscious kakashi home to rest where they decide sasuke should not know of itachis return despite their wishes sasuke finds out and also learns that itachi is after naruto determined to kill itachi for murdering the uchiha clan sasuke rushes out to find naruto though discovers that naruto has already left the village with jiraiya in another town naruto sits in a hotel room while jiraiya tries to pick up women after someone knocks on his door naruto opens it to reveal itachi and kisame standing before him

routine training results in the death of a us navy seal lieutenant just days before he was due to deploy on a classified hostage rescue operation the death is initially dismissed as an equipment malfunction but abby discovers that the link attaching the lieutenant to his rappelling rope was made of a weaker material than factory standard suggesting sabotage and potentially murder pressure is applied by the cia for the investigation to be wrapped up within 38 hours so the operation can continue or else the entire mission which is of national security importance will be scrubbed as the case goes on gibbs discovers that the lieutenant had a secret and that his wife might be holding back vital information about his death meanwhile abby deals with her relationship with mcgee

andy goes on the warpath to prove that officer ed laughlin set up clark on the heroin bust from a week ago andy checks laughlins old arrests and contacts he finds out a non-reformed dealer was asked by laughlin for heroin but declined because he does not trust old ed very much he also meets a punk who offers to lie and save the day and ends up shoving the punks face into a plate of gross-looking barbecue ed once again threatens andy but andys more confident now and ignores ed andy then gets a break when the cops find a guy who was ripped off for the heroin involved in clark being arrested unfortunately the guy is terrified of being killed by his boss and an attempt to get laughlin incriminating himself on tape fails clark jr meanwhile is visited in prison by now-retired clark sr who seems more angry that his son trusts andy more than his drunken self to handle the case than that his son has been framed due to clark srs stupidity clark sr begs andy to help gets useless information and andy tells him hes a drunk just like andy is a broken clark sr asks andy if its his fault his son is in jail and andy pointedly refuses to answer him the light from earlier in the day flickers out when the guy who got ripped off is gunned down on the streets and clark jr asks andy how hes going to beat the case at trial in the b story two young women are raped in public parks theyre both furious at their boyfriends for not comforting them but rita and connie find out the boyfriends were bound and gagged and forced to witness the attacks they also find surprisingly that the rapist—who yelled that he was infecting the girls with hiv—was using a condom during both attacks and that he took off his stocking mask as well the boyfriends stop fronting and id him from photos as an ex-con named will connie tells will they know his sad story how he tried to break into an atm with his car and got 2 years jail time and once he was inside he ended up being raped by just about every bigger older prisoner in the entire place he was left hiv+ carried out the rapes as retaliations and is not sorry about going back to jail and getting more revenge 
andy and connie arrive at a crime scene where ed laughlin tries to act like theyre all colleagues but andy throws him out of the place connie warns andy too much about laughlin getting revenge and andy basically tells her to get lost officer shannon then gestures that he wants to talk to andy and after several false starts says he has information about what happened with clark and laughlin shannon then tells andy lt rodriguez ada haywood and captain fraker how laughlin stole the heroin and said he was using it to even the score with clark fraker isnt moved but caves when the ada demands clarks immediate release laughlin is arrested and dragged out of the stationhouse crying a shocked and relieved clark jr is released after which his father shows up drunk at the 15th telling the uniformed cops he leaked the iab information and his son did nothing wrong clark jr later confronts his dad at home and tells him to stop making decisions for him and a dejected clark sr leaves the episodes crime investigation is of a wealthy gay man who is bankrolling a convict named arturos appeal of his life sentence in exchange for arturo pimping out young latino men to him arturo turns on the guy and has a youth whom he protected in jail go and do a robbery of something that didnt exist arturo is happy about this until andy gives him some bad news andy had planned to honor a deal between them for information that would keep arturo in a prison close to his family but now andys going to call in a favor from a bop friend and have arturo sent to a freezing prison thats 11 hours from the city for the rest of his life a woman who tried to help female gang members leave the life is murdered and rita zeroes in on a vulnerable young woman whose boyfriend may have been involved the cops find out a meek neighbor arranged for the boyfriend to rob the womans place out of anger that a close friend of his was evicted before she moved in and the boyfriend stabbed her to death 
domestic issues begin to weigh heavily on andy and connie with andy being so irritated by their arguments about chores and taking care of the kids that he covertly inquires whether paa john might be willing to let him have his old apartment back john is polite but later makes a pointed reference to a florist recommended by the police association since andy had ridiculously claimed the jobs scrutiny was the reason he might have to stop cohabitating with connie however andy gets a new perspective on a case involving a pompous insurance guy who was set up for robbery after nearly cheating on his wife with a transvestite prostitute and connie decides to put together a romantic meal that sets everything right the other cops investigate the murder of a girl from pakistan her father does not care she was killed and says hes only sorry he didnt do it himself as shed disgraced the family by dating an american a slackerish white guy who is sorry shes dead but equally useless on whodunit the killer turns out to be a random homeless insane guy who murdered a complete stranger because of the demons driving him on 
 
julian pisano the half-helpful half-worthless snitch from season 9 was shot and wounded during what he claims was a carjacking though andy and clark jr dont really buy his story however a random video recorder caught the shooting on tape and leads the cops to a hitman with a bad back who tells them that julians wife and her lover hired him to murder julian julian does not want to believe them but the cops especially andy tell him they have to play things cool or shell get away with attempted murder connie and rita catch a case where a woman was scammed for 100 in the street and the woman gets increasingly annoyed and complains to a high level of the nypd when no restitution is provided connie and rita are equally annoyed with her until the womans neighbor tells them that before she was scammed a hit and run driver killed her 8-year old son both cases are thrown into a new light when clark jr goes to check on his father and finds clark sr dead on the couch with his brains splattered on the wall behind him andy has clark jr retrieve his fathers gun cleaning kit and gets the arriving me to say that clark sr died cleaning his gun a police cover for an officers suicide that allows his family to claim his death benefits clark jr is in complete shock and ritas attempts to talk to him dont work the other cops eerily stage a scene of julian posing as dead and andy goes to meet julians wife posing as a hitman the ploy works and she gets arrested but not before screaming that she gave her lover everything because hes a real man when the complainant in the scam case shows up connie gathers the 100 from the squad members and julian agrees to pose as one of the two scammers to give her some closure julian then breaks into tears while recounting his wifes real betrayal and the woman somehow ends up consoling him at night clark jr goes home and watches a farewell video from his father before breaking into tears of his own

 japan 
stranded following the events of the orichalcos the kaibas extend to joey and yugi an invitation for the kaiba grand championship kc grand prix in japan in exchange for tickets back home one of the attractions is a duel computer that allows novices to refine their duelling skills however an enigmatic hacker locks all the guests in and sets the difficulty to expert leaving the amateur duelist rick facing an immensely difficult task yugi duels instead but he uses ricks deck full of dragons and next-to-no magic and trap cards  
due to rick stacking his deck with dragons and only one magic card yugi is backed into a corner by the expert-difficulty duel computer who forces yugi to discard his hand yugi activates the card he gave to rick heart of the underdog to power up his spirit ryu and restore the computer to normal  
the grand championship starts in earnest with joey facing off against the mysterious apdnarg otom or grandpa solomon moto backwards who allegedly begged to be in the tournament solomon turns joeys reliance on luck against him and leads an assault with the ancient giant  
joey is being beaten by his former teacher solomon moto who sacrifices most of his cards to summon the legendary ancient dragon a card hes been waiting to play for years slowly joey begins a comeback using gilford the lightning to destroy the dragon but its futile as it immediately resurrects itself with ancient city joey counters this by returning it to solomons hand with giant trunade and launching a double assault with gilford the lightning and goblin attack force  
rebecca is duelling against the asian champion vivian wong not just for a place in the next round but for yugis heart rebecca uses a clever strategy to gain life points and burn away vivians each round and even when vivian hinders it with dragon lady rebecca makes a winning counter with guardian angel joan rex and weevil have sneaked into the tournament against rules under another competitor and despite both duelling zigfried lloyd he obliterates both of them in one turn with a single card ride of the valkyries walkuren ritt in the japanese version  
joey is pitted against zigfried who previously defeated two duelists in one move using one card after a bad start the facilities around kaibaland go haywire even putting the duelists themselves in danger all zigfrieds work in an attempt to give kaiba a hint after joey makes a stinging direct attack with jinzo zigfried focuses back on the duel playing the ride of the valkyries card he used last time against rex and weevil which easily defeated them in one turn  
with the aid of his hyper refresh joey survives with only 800 life points remaining zigfried decides to try a different tactic  
the elite eight in the kc grand championship have been filtered down to four semi-finalists zigfried lloyd against balfry ginger and the child prodigies rebecca and leon rebeccas gain-and-drain strategy is torn asunder by leons fairytale-based cards in another attempt rebecca uses her dragons but leon summons cinderella in response who attacks rebecca directly repeatedly meanwhile yugis grandfather has mysteriously gone missing  
vivian is revealed to have taken grandpa from the hospital to act as bait for yugi to duel her in exchange she would heal grandpas back the two duel and yugi uses her strategy of discarding dragons to the graveyard to his advantage with dark paladin leon is royally trouncing rebecca but the latter refuses to give in more so when yugi finally arrives to cheer her on heartened rebecca summons her diamond head dragon and launches a brutal assault but leon ultimately triumphs with thorn princess leon will now face zigfried in the finals  
kaiba stops the match disqualifying zigfried for using a false alias and revealing him as zigfried von schroder kaibas former arch-rival and the tournament saboteur the two then duel to determine whether zigfried stays in the tournament kaiba summons his xyz-dragon cannon but zigfried uses the nibelungs ring and his three goddesses to remove kaibas cards  
kaiba calls his immensely powerful chaos emperor dragon - envoy of the end to reset the playing field destroying zigfrieds hand his field and even his ace card valkyrie brunnhilde zigfried ups his play by reviving his valkyrie and forcing both players to predict how many magic cards they think theyll play or take serious damage if theyre incorrect seto uses a combo of soul release spell reproduction and dimension fusion to summon five dragons at once and together they destroy brunnhilde and win the duel  
leon is stopped by zigfried and is given a card to his deck for his battle against yugi for the title of world champion leon is unusually bitter about it and oddly considering his last duel doesnt appear to be enjoying himself he launches countless assaults replacing destroyed monsters with more fairytale creatures and reveals he too is a von schroder despite this kaiba cannot call off the match as that is against the tournament rules  
leon reveals his motivation to duel stemming from being ignored by his family in favor of the smart highly gifted and talented zigfried to distract himself leon became engrossed in fairytales and started dueling following the creation of a set of fairytale cards he initially believed this was earning zigfrieds respect but in reality his older brother saw him as little more than a tool for destroying kaibacorp determined to earn his elder brothers love leon plays an illegal field spell the golden castle of stromberg which infects kaibacorps systems with an extremely powerful and dangerous computer virus that rapidly deletes the files and cant be destroyed by card or trap effects  
yugi decides to help leon get rid of the golden castle of stromberg but this proves to be challenging as not only is it unaffected by card effects it forces all monsters to battle and discards half of yugis deck each turn this proves to be its undoing however as hes left with one card and so cant discard half of it destroying the card leon fights valiantly but loses to yugis dark magician zigfried is furious with this but leon manages to calm him down and forgives him yugi and his best friends are finally able to go back home

the pharaoh continues his battle between zorc in the memory world yugi joey and others summon monsters such as the dark magician to help the pharaoh the ancient characters cannot be read but yugi is going to reveal the pharaohs true name tea then remembers the cartouche pendant and passes it to the pharaoh the pharaoh regained his true name atem the keyword which allowed him to summon the three egyptian gods and fuse them together to form the creator of light horakhty horakhty is a level 12 warrior-type divine-god attribute monster with infinite attack and defense points the pharaoh then attacks zorc directly with horakhtys shining light attack which results in zorc being destroyed forever later the pharaoh entrusts the millennium items to priest seto his soul was released from the shadow realm and makes him the next pharaoh of egypt then pharaoh atems body dissolves since his role in the past was over even as priest seto promises to rule egypt justly afterwards atem and his friends leave the memory world of the past

yugi is successful in defeating the egyptian gods however atem is not worried at all atem admits that he knew that yugi would defeat the egyptian gods now the real duel begins between yugi and atem now yugi must face his most trusted creature the dark magician if he wants to help atem note when this aired in the us the ending said to be concluded instead of to be continued thus signifying the end of the series  
 
yugi tries his best to fend off the attacks from atems most powerful trump card the dark magician yugi then plays his spell card gold sarcophagus the power of the gold sarcophagus is it can negate the effects of another magic card that is stored in the chest yugi was finally able to defeat the dark magician with his silent magician atem tries to activate the spell card monster reborn so he can revive slifer the sky dragon but when yugi opens the gold sarcophagus to reveal the card he sealed the card was monster reborn it means neither of them can use that card in this game it is yugis message to the other yugi that those of the dead should not remain in the world of the living yugi finally defeats atem but immediately collapses on his knees crying despite atem telling him that yugi shouldnt cry yugi tells atem that he yugi is a coward and that atem was always his goal atem comforts yugi that he isnt a coward and yugis victory has finally set him free atem then departs into the afterlife while yugi and his friends begin a new journey then the millennium stone shatters which causes the seven millennium items to fall into the pit left behind also the shrine collapses and shadis spirit is seen here one last time everybody barely makes it out in time as a result of the shrines destruction the millennium items are buried forever then yugi tells joey that sometimes the end of one adventure is only beginning of another this concludes the end of the 4-kids version of the story

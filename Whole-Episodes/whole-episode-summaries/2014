campsite that they originally lived during the three month period where josh was trapped because sally has come up with an idea while nora locks herself up in the shed she enters joshs mind before he changes she discovers josh in his mind as she knows the only way to solve things is to find the part of josh that is missing otherwise the wolf will take over once more josh knows full well the other part of him that is missing and it is his wolf that he runs away from at the house aidan has called on kenny to have a clean up lying to him that the pack killed astrid on their own before coming to the house and josh turning on them in reality he has hidden astrids corpse upstairs in ramonas room he tells kenny that the only thing left for him is to leave boston for good in joshs mind sally sees the futility of his plan of running away from the wolf and hiding during the change but sally makes him stand his ground first by creating a happy place for himself to make the confrontation the house

leaves the room he does not notice that there are now twelve scratch marks in the old bloodstain when before there were only six josh nora and sally return to the house to find it spotless and reveals the lie he told kenny to them so they can cover for each other josh thanks him for keeping him safe and sally informs him that he must always confront the wolf or the wolf will win in the funeral home

in the 15 minutes after the events of the botched robbery/stunt ethan asks valentina to get medical attention and she does—from remi who discovers the next day after he stitched his wounds that ethan is one of the suspects and tells valentina who wants ethan to turn himself in but after she leaves the police stops her she was reaching for her tissue and was swerving while driving and they discover ethans blood stains in the back seat marisol discovers that nicholas who had been using painkillers and is making him woozy just confessed to her about being a murderer after the detectives arrive to question him about the hit-and-run and when she tries to get him to admit about what he did but refuses to tell her upon finding out about that opal blackmailed him marisol takes off her wedding ring and tells nicholas that she will not be waiting for him rosie becomes more concerned about kenneth after discovering that reggie is taking advantage of using his uncles fortune as reggie puts kenneth in the hospital after reggie refuses to give up the power of attorney upon discovering that reggie is spending the money and hurting his uncles company holdings spence starts to show signs of becoming an alcoholic after he loses custody of his son to peri and ends up taking a concerned carmen along for the ride zoila convinces geneveive to come home to face her mother in the effort to bury the hatchet but the defrosting knocks both women out cold when the mother suffers a stroke 
marisol continues to put the pieces to the puzzle on how nicholas was run down and when the detectives tell her that there were no skid marks at the site she suspects opal is responsible after she sees the camera footage of opal leaving in the car after nicholas jog but when opal arrives to face marisol she pulls out a gun to kill marisol but ethan stops his mother and confesses to marisol about opal pushing dahlia over the bridge and as marisol calls the police opal takes the gun and shoots herself in the head valentina is forced by zoila and pablo to turn ethan in as he attempts to leave town and hopefully at the same time keep valentina out of jail when pablo tells his daughter about his time in jail the intervention brings zoila and pablo closer while valentina tells remi that shell do the right thing and they too also embrace again rosie is learning that reggie is going to send kenneth to a nursing home in sacramento and when she visits kenneth to help him she is confronted by reggie who threatens rosie with deporting her if she reports him to the police now that adrian knows about tonys scheme to blackmail evelyn adrian turns the tables on tony by paying him off and to end his affair with evelyn unfortunately tony is later assaulted at the atm by a minion of adrians spences downward spiral continues to take a toll on carmen when his drinking starts to affect his work prompting carmen and rosie to intervene by telling spence that he needs to go to rehab

marisol discovers that the evidence she found lacks the proof needed to turn nicholas in so she forces nicholas to come clean and tell the truth to the parents of the boy he accidentally killed 15 years earlier the powells whose 25th wedding anniversary is dredging up more personal problems nicholas finally comes clean to evelyn and adrian about how he accidentally killed barrett dahlia told him about her affair while he was driving and did not see barrett which causes an enraged adrian to slice nicholas with a knife while evelyn keeps adrian composed marisol tells them that nicholas will turn himself over to the police the confession also brings the powells closer together as they both decide to forgive each other for all the wrongdoings that have occurred spence asks rosie to marry him and she accepts but thanks to his divorce and losing his job rosie has to find a way to cut back and carmens job is one of them after carmen is fired she discovers that her demo was passed on to a guy who happens to be the husband of a female record executive after she slept with him zoila is stunned to find out that pablo is a donor match for genevieve and decides to end her relationship with javier because she wants to give pablo a second chance only to change her mind later when she learns that helen is the one that broke up with pablo and that pablo had been lying the whole time this throws a wrench in genevieves surgery but at the same time produces a shocking result for zoila when the doctor who did the test tells zoila that shes pregnant valentina is offered an internship in new york but remi decides not to follow her because of his moms illness at the same time ty decides to carry out his plot to kill valentina after his partners bail out by stealing spences gun and sets his sights on targeting valentina at the wedding as rosie and spence finally tie the knot rosie is unaware that back in mexico her supposedly dead husband was found alive after the mexican federal police breaks up a drug operation at the wedding ty fires multiple shots at the crowd but not before being spotted by carmen the episode ends on a cliffhanger as the last scene shows rosie dropping her blood-covered bouquet unknown as to who was actually shot

when tom and weaver are released from solitary confinement an espheni overlord speaking through a harnessed child informs the residents that the food supply will be ceased until the vigilante is handed over meanwhile anne and the 2nd mass capture a skitter and learn that the espheni plan to use the captured children as hybrids at chinatown ben learns from dr kadar that lexi may be dying and that lourdes had prevented him from helping her concerned about her well being ben voices his concerns to lexi and convinces her to meet him back at the ghetto tom and hal meet with dingaan bootha who informs them that he had escaped from an espheni ghetto before and tells them that he had created a faraday suit to scale the fence and a working radio when tom decides to use the radio to contact cochise he learns that the espheni power source is offensive in nature and that they had found matts location dressed as the vigilante tom surrenders himself to the overlord and is taken aboard the ship while there the overlord tells him of their plan for humanity and about what they had done to the rebel skitters faced with an ultimatum from the overlord to save his family tom takes advantage of the ensuing chaos when the ghettos residents launch projectiles against the ship and examines the ghetto layout and power source before being released meanwhile ben and maggie bond over lexi and tom informs weaver that he had made a deal with the overlord later that night ben discovers a distraught lexi talking with an overlord 
tom makes the decision to put his escape plan into action when he learns that the espheni plan to turn humanity into skitters he then gathers hal pope weaver and dingaan and tector and explains that while dingaan scales the fence in the faraday suit he will draw the skitters away hal meanwhile is tasked with leading the ghetto residents into the tunnels and pope and weaver are told to cover dingaan the next day tom meets with an overlord and an harnessed child when he tells them that the deal they had is off he attacks the overlord with a flamethrower and draws the skitters away dingaan meanwhile is injured which forces pope to wear the faraday suit and scale the fence to destroy the tether with the charge hal waits with the ghetto residents in the tunnel and is forced to defend them from incoming skitters and tom meanwhile draws the chasing skitters into a building covered with explosives when tom notices that pope is successful in destroying the tether he detonates the explosives and jumps into the water in triumph anne meanwhile collapses and dreams that she is onboard an espheni ship while heavily pregnant when she notices karen and an overlord affecting her unborn child she despairs at the re-education camp matt puts himself in danger when he covers for mira and is taken away by kent matthews in chinatown maggie confronts lexi after learning from ben that she was talking with an overlord and is told that she believes it wants peace later that day anne awakens and leads the 2nd mass to chinatown and reunites with ben lexi and lourdes to her delight that night tom reunites with hal pope and weaver and thanks pope for his help with the escape 
tom and the 2nd mass survivors arrive at the volm hideout and are immediately met by cochise who introduces his second in command shaq when cochise explains that they have matts location with the help of recon drones tom departs along with weaver and cochise leaving hal behind in charge with orders to gather ammunition and supplies when hal orders that the group stay within the perimeter pope disobeys and leaves in a pickup truck to get the fuel meanwhile tom is forced to leave cochise behind when he is attacked by a mutated jeanne and enters the reeducation camp along with weaver while inside tom and weaver immediately separate when the children raise the alarm and with the help of mira tom rescues matt who is attacked by kent matthews at the farm pope is confronted by sara when he finds the fuel and nonchalantly agrees to have a beer with her which is drugged that night pope awakens and is forced to work with sara to repel the espheni mechs when mira distracts the skitter guards tom escapes along with matt and promises to come back for them weaver is faced with a mutated jeanne who dies trying to protect him and despairs when pope and sara return to the warehouse hal confronts him but is forced to break camp when news of a forthcoming espheni attack breaks leaving behind a coded message for his father anne along with the 2nd mass confront an overlord speaking through ben who tells them he believes humanity can live in peace with the espheni they however are forced to back down when lexi awakens her powers to protect the overlord shortly afterwards an emotional weaver reunites with tom matt and cochise and explains what had happened to jeanne 
tom returns to the volm hideout along with matt weaver and cochise but theyre not alone when tom deciphers the message left by hal and learns where the group is headed he escapes from the scorched overlord and skitters pinned down by espheni patrols hal turns to the volm for assistance at chinatown anne questions the captured overlord but when lexi confronts her and collapses after using her powers anne enlists the help of dr kadar and learns she has a fever of over 120 degrees cochise leaves the group to rejoin his recon team and gives tom his blessing tom discovers a campsite occupied by two men called nick and cooper but he is suspicious of their story and voices his concerns to weaver that night tom is abducted by the men who reveal that the espheni have a high price on his head the next day sara turns to pope for training and together they disable an espheni mech with their pickup truck weaver attempts to calm matt down as they track the men but he doesnt listen tom tells cooper of how matt was only 8 when the espheni invaded and that he knew he was a father to which he responds that he had 2 sons who are now dead weaver and matt locate the men but when matt breaks down crying weaver comforts him cooper shoots nick dead after learning he was responsible for the death of his sons and is killed by weaver before he can kill tom concerned for lexi anne demands the overlords help to save her but is unaware ben is connected to it and causes him agonizing pain when she attacks it maggie overhears the word flower and tells anne of the message and ben with the help of a mech transmitter and the volm hal learns of the espheni patrol locations meanwhile anne treats lexi but that night lourdes frees the overlord and lexi tells anne that its her father 
tom reunites with anne and his family in chinatown but he is faced with news that lexi is in a cocoon concerned for lexi anne wants to cut her out but is stopped by tom who warns against acting rashly with the group now gathered dr kadar compares lexis cocoon to that of a butterfly and believes a different lexi may emerge from it shaq mentions that the volm have never recovered someone alive from one which leaves anne faced with recalling repressed memories at the suggestion of dr kadar in her first attempt anne recalls her last moments with her son sammy dr kadar watches on as she tries again and suggests to tom to spend time by lexis side while there tom is comforted by weaver who reminds him that lexi will always be his daughter maggie meanwhile holds a gathering of 2nd mass members and voices her concerns about lexi and her powers tom however overhears pope suggest they kill her and warns them against acting pope tells him that he believes there is a conflict of interest going on as he leaves hal tells tom that he believes they have valid concerns but he doesnt listen faced with the prospect of using armed force to protect lexi tom discusses the situation with lourdes later that night shaq tells hal of the volms experiences with espheni cocoons and that theyre retreating to a safe distance hearing this pope leads a group towards tom demanding access to lexi tom holds firm and is able to diffuse the situation anne in her dream state meets with lexi who shows her a childhood memory and tells how she choose her at the espheni tower over karen and then helps her awaken anne immediately rushes to lexis side and touches the cocoon lexis eyes open 
lexi emerges from her cocoon and reveals to her family that shes leaving chinatown because of her doubts about human nature although faced with objections from tom and anne she walks into the crowd gathered outside and kills lourdes through pity when she begs her to stay shocked by lexis actions tom and anne turn to dr kadar for answers and hear how she has changed at the cellular level when anthony reveals that a large espheni force led by the scorched overlord is gathered outside of chinatown tom believes that they havent attacked with beamers because its personal the volm destroy an important bridge while the 2nd mass lay traps around the area and then prepare for a ground assault that night maggie uses thermite to destroy some mechs while tector saves pope and sara they however are faced with a gas explosion from a ruptured gas line which kills most of the 2nd mass later that night ben finds lexi and attempts to reason with her in the hope she will return but she doesnt listen and instead controls him and leads him to a waiting espheni beamer with chinatown in ruin tom tells the 2nd mass survivors that this wont be over until the espheni believe they are dead and orders them to evacuate to an underground bomb shelter when hal arrives he notices maggie isnt there and is stopped from leaving when the door closes behind him tom and anne are saddened when dr kadar dies from a deep shrapnel wound distressed by the deaths and wanting vengeance against the overlord tom asks tector for his gun but is tricked into leaving dressed as the ghost tector shoots the overlord and misses and then blows himself up the 2nd mass anxiously wait underground and tom awakens under the rubble 
the 2nd mass emerge from the shelter and search for survivors with tom and maggie still missing matt believes his father is still alive hal meanwhile finds maggie and learns from anne that she may be paralyzed tom meanwhile rescues dingaan from under some rubble and together they discover a crashed beamer tom suggests that they board it to escape but dingaan is skeptical now at a skitter farm ben witnesses humans being transformed and hears from lexi that she believes it to be the solution for humanity he strongly objects calling it genocide she then releases him when cochise suggests to hal and anne that they use dennys spike fluid to heal maggie denny is willing and hal agrees but anne wants maggie to agree to the procedure first but when maggie refuses hal tricks anne into performing it anyway when the treatment is unsuccessful ben suggests a spike transplant anne is concerned but agrees and uses volm technology to implant some of bens spikes into maggie which heals her now inside the beamer tom is affected by a parasite after touching a panel and asks dingaan to pull it out when they trigger a missile onboard the beamer they both shield themselves from the blast and dingaan breaks down over the beeping telling tom it reminds him of his wifes heart monitor before she died tom comforts him and together they escape when the explosion draws the 2nd mass to them hal meanwhile thanks ben for his help but he tells him he didnt do it for him later that night the 2nd mass gather around the fire and mourn the loss of tector and lourdes while tom and hal witness a strange light on the moon when the beamer activates 
tom decides to lead a small team consisting of himself anne matt weaver and cochise to a volm supply cache after learning the location from cochise believing that it may hold something of use to help unearth the buried beamer when they arrive mira tells them that she had escaped from the espheni camp and that she had waited for someone to appear tom is suspicious believing it to be too convenient that she had appeared near to a volm supply cache and decides to tie her up as the area is toxic to breath they wear gas masks and begin to unearth the weapons mira however attempts to appeal to matt telling him that shes okay and that the rope is hurting her arms feeling sorry for her matt decides to untie her but when she blows a whistle that can alert beamers to her location he chases after her and brings her to tom and tells him what she had done but before they can react kent matthews appears and attacks the group mira uses the opportunity to escape once again and is followed by matt anne immediately comes to toms aid and distracts kent matthews to buy tom the time to shoot him dead meanwhile matt is rescued by weaver and cochise when he is incapacitated by some of the camps children with the group reunited they decide to return back to chinatown 
tom is faced with uncertainty when the 2nd mass demand that he offer them a vote on who should pilot the beamer on the mission to the moon tom is initially against the idea as he believes that he should be involved anne however convinces him to allow anyone to place their name in contention for the role that night with the 2nd mass gathered tom draws bens name and his own anne however believes he had rigged the draw which tom admits stating that he couldnt let ben go without him the next day the 2nd mass are attacked by beamers but are saved by lexi who destroys them with her ability 
the 2nd mass struggle with lexis presence in the area believing it may be a trap tom does not want anything more to do with her and asks her to leave but anne tells him to give her a chance lexi tells anne that shes sorry and admits that she was wrong about the espheni and that she wants to make up for her mistakes she then offers to join tom on the mission to which anne initially refuses but is convinced by weaver to allow her faced with mistrust from all sides lexi joins tom on the beamer and unbeknownst to her hal gives tom a poison to use on her just incase as the beamer leaves the earths atmosphere lexi and tom realize that there isnt enough power to maintain life support both ways lexi suggests that she and tom enter a cocoon together and tells him that its a form of stasis during the dream tom is back on earth and seemingly the power core is destroyed and the espheni are on the backfoot however he becomes suspicious when things are too perfect and quickly realizes that what he is seeing is not real he then demands that lexi release him from the dream however she is unsure how as they have a father daughter moment and bond over what issues they had they try once again and awaken and notice that theyre close to the moon 
shortly after tom and lexis departure the 2nd mass spreads their forces thinly to defend their territory however when dingaans squadron are taken down by surprise a beamer drops a container on the 2nd mass containing newly developed harnesses which are able to skitterize humans upon contact without the need for a factory meanwhile as tom and lexi make their approach to the moon their payload becomes ruptured due to the hull leak when the espheni power core finally comes into view however their beamer is captured by the burnt overlord after a skirmish tom manages to inject the volm poison into the overlord-killing him but not before the overlord destroys his ships autopilot seeing no other alternative to destroy the power core lexi opts to manually pilot the espheni ship on a collision course with the core meanwhile the 2nd mass puts up a valiant yet hopeless fight against the harnesses at the same time after tom and lexi say their goodbyes they are ambushed by a squadron of beamers however the volm battleship arrives and takes the beamers out giving lexi the opportunity to finally destroy the power core the resulting explosion subsequently knocks toms beamer into deep space while back on earth the harnesses and all espheni technology lose their power the next morning the 2nd mass regroups and cochise brings them the news of the success of the mission but that tom may be lost to the depths of space despite this hal rallies the 2nd mass to finally go on the offensive against the espheni elsewhere tom awakens in a room aboard another spaceship and encounters a new alien who he seems to be acquainted with

cristina comes to experience two very different universes—on a quest to answer the question do you know who you are—after she does very difficult heart repair work on her patient who is on a ventilator and paralyzed from the neck down in the first universe the patient decides that he wants to be taken off the ventilator which sends cristina into owen’s arms when she realizes that they are throwing away their love for each other time is quickly passing as the two get married move in together get a dog have a baby await the birth of their second child and see ross win the harper avery award for cristinas trial that she quit on to take care of her family the second universe begins when cristina comes back to reality and her patient says he doesn’t want to be taken off the ventilator this once again sends cristina into owens arms but this time shes happy however the stipulation that they will never have kids still remains which owen initially accepts they continue to have their on-again off-again relationship which drives owen to drinking more than he should putting himself and his patients in grave danger cristina tells him its over for good and she goes on to win the harper avery award for four straight years once again cristina comes back to reality this time her patient decides to be taken off the ventilator however she’s able to save jackson from injuring his hand and her hesitancy to approach owen allows meredith to approach her about a patient which allows owen to get on the elevator before she can greet him 
a virus breaks out at grey sloan memorial hospital because of the close encounters of doctors and patients the virus spreads like wild fire it first knocks out jackson then leah and finally derek its an inopportune time for derek to get sick because its the day of his presentation on brain mapping to fill in for him meredith steps up and delivers her own twist on his speech callie teaches jo about the joys of ortho and how it presents the opportunity to take out all frustration on the patient while helping them plus it pays cristina and owen team up to work on a pair of sisters who have cardiomyopathy caused by an unknown source and even though they caught the issue in time the sisters brother starts showing similar symptoms because cristina is busy on this case shane has to step up and take care of the babies in cristinas trial aka her baby alex receives an offer from a doctor who runs his own private practice alex seriously considers and starts to discuss it with jo april and bailey operate on a child who is very susceptible to infection due to his condition that is no longer treatable with the enzyme treatments he was previously receiving 
its that time of year when the nominees for the annual harper avery award are announced and grey sloan memorial hospitals own dr cristina yang is one of them her fellow colleagues are all very ecstatic for her nomination except for meredith and dr bailey to mask her jealousy meredith makes a celebratory toast to cristina dr bailey however is less efficient at hiding her feelings cristinas self-esteem takes a blow when her patients family doubts her abilities and says that her best is bad alex tells jo that he called to accept the offer from dr butt hole to work for his private practice derek and callie take the next step in their research by getting baseline measurements of brain activity callie finds out that although she has a great life one thing is holding her back from being truly happy a baby callie tells arizona she wants another baby and arizona says she wants one too owen tells cristina that hes looked at the other nominees research and hes confident that shell win cristina agrees 
it’s the day before the winner of the harper avery award is honored and cristina has plans with meredith to go to joe’s have a few shots of tequila and write her acceptance speech before she can engage in those plans her patients’ parents start arguing which endangers the kids’ health both girls reject their hearts while their brother still awaits his transplant while babysitting zola and bailey callie and arizona decide that callie will carry their second baby april and jackson also face off when jackson thinks that it’s ludicrous that his patient’s parents don’t want a cochlear implant for their deaf daughter april substitutes her faith for the cochlear implant and jackson suddenly sees the problem april then shows up on the doorstep of callie and arizona’s place asking to stay for a while cristina who goes to the harper avery award ceremony by herself has last second doubts about being there alone and calls meredith after pulling herself together she walks in to locate her table only to find meredith and owen waving her over unfortunately cristina does not win the harper avery award 
meredith owen and cristina all return to grey sloan memorial hospital after cristinas loss at the harper avery award ceremony april still residing with callie and arizona drives them nuts she feels that her fight with jackson is the end of their relationship jackson is feeling pressured to cut back on the hospitals research funds and projects and must decide whose research will be terminated richard travels across the country with plans to propose to catherine avery but finds out the real reason why cristina lost to her competition because the hospital is owned by the harper avery foundation no doctor that works there will ever win the award meanwhile back at grey sloan memorial hospital cristina is faced with the decision of which patient will get the heart transplant amelia dereks sister makes a surprise visit to see if she can have the life derek and meredith have alex gives the board his notice that he’ll be accepting the private practice offer april tells jackson that they can’t forget about their hypothetical children per jacksons request because shes pregnant 
in an attempt to get back at catherine avery webber calls an emergency board meeting…without jackson the board wants to appeal the harper avery award which would have gone to cristina if the harper avery foundation didnt own her hospital hunt convinces cristina to accept an invitation to speak at a hospital in switzerland during the lecture a questioner from the back turns out to be none other than dr preston burke meanwhile back at grey sloan memorial hospital amelia and derek team up to work on conjoined twins who share a brain burke offers a job to cristina while showing her his hospital but it’s not just a job working for him instead it’s his job jackson and april start to mend their broken relationship when he agrees to attend church with her and their baby as long as she agrees to waffles afterwards callie and arizona are thinking about baby names agamemnon being a favorite of callie’s alex is loving his job at the private practice but jo is starting to sink under the pressure of her duties the residents learn that someone amongst them is going to get fired stephanie figures out that bailey administered the deactivated hiv virus to her bubble-boy patient despite his parents wishes and thinks it’s brilliant 
dr bailey faces legal charges of assault and battery after she reveals to bradens parents that she implemented the deactivated hiv treatment despite their wishes in an attempt to get cristina to stay at grey sloan memorial hospital owen puts cristina in charge of screening applicants for the position of head of cardio april and jackson have their first ob/gyn visit and decide not to tell anyone yet callie is heartbroken when she goes to the ob/gyn because its revealed that she has too many adhesions from the car accident to be able to carry derek comes back from washington dc with news of a job offer to work at the national institutes of health nih and a job offer for meredith at james madison hospital amelia confides in meredith that she wants to call off her engagement in order to move to seattle dr webber tells leah that shes not fit to be a surgeon and consequently cuts her from the residency program 
the day has arrived that cristina leaves for zurich but a possible act of terrorism delays her departure before she can get to the mall to buy a european phone charger an explosion at the mall sends multiple injured victims to the grey sloan memorial hospital leah comes to the er when she hears about the explosion but leaves with no goodbyes when she sees every patient had been treated april receives a pep talk from catherine avery her mother-in-law when she starts to fear raising a baby in a world that is so dangerous cristina looking for closure can’t leave the hospital until she and meredith dance it out one last time shane demands that he take control of his education and leaves to work under cristina in zurich meredith tells derek that she can’t leave seattle the place where she grew up and made her life she’s not going to washington dc despite what derek says callie and arizona consider having a surrogate mother carry their future baby after treating a surrogate who was burned by the explosion bailey is nominated for a position on the board by webber due to cristina’s departure however cristina left karev her shares of the hospital and her board position webber connects with dr pierce the new head of cardio and finds out that her birth mother was ellis grey 


now that cristina is no longer at grey sloan memorial hospital maggie pierce must step up to the plate as the new cardiothoracic surgeon meredith and maggie clash in the or in true sister fashion as their personalities are complete opposites callie and arizona debate over the use of a surrogate callie initially doesn’t want a surrogate but then changes her mind realizing one cant control everything arizona wants to shelf the idea altogether in order to become a fetal surgery fellow which means going back to school alex and bailey vie for cristinas position on the board with bailey stating may the best surgeon win richard jackson and derek try to distract owen from cristinas departure by inviting him to hang out on a man date thing meredith leans to alex to console the loss of her best friend which colors jo green with envy derek tells meredith that he chooses her and the kids over his brain mapping initiative in washington dc 
maggie is trying to find her niche at grey sloan memorial hospital and she’s finding that it’s easier with some more than others jo trying to win over maggie tells her about alex’s dilemma involving dr oliver lebackes’ private practice and his seat on the board maggie discloses this information during surgery with the two which results in alex being fired from the private practice however maggie finds comfort and the beginning of a friendship in amelia and finds out that meredith isn’t so bad to know maggie expresses interest in baileys genome mapping project and she uses it and cristinas research with the mcneil family to solve their familys case the childrens cardiomyopathy was caused by a gene mutation after an extended argument callie decides that arizona should do the fetal surgery fellowship and that they would work it out with having a second child due to her conversation with amelia maggie tells meredith that ellis grey is her mother too meredith doesn’t believe her saying that at 5 years old she would have known if her mother was pregnant 
things seem to be falling apart at grey sloan memorial hospital owen takes callie to a veteran’s hospital with hopes of her using her lab to provide wounded veterans robotic legs however she’s not able to help one of the veterans due to damaged nerves until jackson steps in as alex tries to prepare for his presentation to fill cristina’s position on the board meredith distracts him with the news of her new half-sister maggie searching through hospital records meredith finds out that maggie is indeed her half-sister ellis was unknowingly pregnant when she was admitted for slitting her wrists derek and amelia fight over being the chief of neurosurgery which makes derek second guess his decision to stay in seattle with the new fellowship and the wounded veterans project arizona is concerned about having the time to have another baby causing callie to once again doubt their future together richard attempts to tell maggie that he is her father but she already knew who he was and faults him for not telling her sooner alex and bailey go head to head in front of the board for the open spot bailey is given the seat leaving alex without a job 
in a series of flashbacks meredith and richard come to terms with their past relationships with ellis in order to sort out the new revelation of having a half-sister meredith goes searching through her mother’s diaries and video footage alex learns that the board’s vote to replace cristina wasn’t as close as arizona led him to believe in fact the vote was unanimously in favor of bailey alex confronts arizona about her lie and she confides in him that she didnt vote for him because she wanted to hire him as the new pediatrics attending so she could take a step back focus on the fetal surgery fellowship and save her marriage meredith and derek are still feuding over his decision to stay in seattle but the argument subsides once maggie tells him she is meredith’s half-sister not only does derek learn the truth but so does bailey from richard when she tries to reverse maggie’s decision to leave grey sloan memorial hospital meredith asks richard what was said the day at the carousel and richard reveals that was the day he left ellis for good he only stayed with adele because of his hatred and jealousy of ellis’ first harper avery award nomination for the grey method meredith is able to recover her repressed memories of ellis’ pregnancy by leafing through ellis’ 1983 diary and talking to richard meredith has a change of heart about maggie once she talks to the mother of her patient 
callie and arizona find themselves in marriage counseling and a product thereof is a 30-day separation no talking and no sex during their separation arizona is granted more time to focus on her fellowship and sharpen her fetal surgery skills however she messes up one too many times and finds herself getting a final warning from dr herman arizona not only embarrasses dr herman in the or but she upsets alex by not allowing him to do his job as the pediatrics attending callie becomes closer to meredith since theyre both going through the same thing of feeling a real disconnect from their spouses after a successful 30 day separation arizona expresses her love to callie and says she needs her callie doesnt reciprocate and says that she felt free during the separation and needs more time to love herself with that she leaves arizona alone with the counselor

prior to dinner service as part of the punishment the losing chefs have to cut pumpkins during which rochelle cuts her thumb she is sent to the hospital but eventually returns in time for dinner service

all of the chefs were summoned downstairs where ramsay and some security guards were waiting after a rigorous security check everyone was led outside and told to expect the arrival of some vip guests after several limos pulled up to the entrance the days vips - the chefs loved ones - got out of the limos rochelles fiance and parents were first followed by melanies boyfriend and mother jasons girlfriend and mother and finally scotts wife son and daughter they all went back into the dining room and enjoyed a dish that ramsay had prepared for them 
as a reward jason went on a tour of some of los angeles finest restaurants first with sous chef andi to the fig &amp olive and then with his girlfriend and mother at ink in addition he also won a set of all clad stainless steel cookware that was waiting for him up in the dorm following the challenge as punishment melanie rochelle and scott had to move all of the furniture not being used out of the dorms and prep the kitchen for that nights dinner service however melanie and rochelle decided not to do any of the work hoping that scott would tire himself out and sabotage his chances of getting into the final melanie openly hoped for an all-female final though rochelle did not seem to care who she might face 
after service was complete ramsay asked each chef to name one other chef who ought to be eliminated scott named melanie for being the weakest performer of the night melanie named scott for his inconsistency for much of the season rochelle named jason for being too easygoing at the start of his time running the pass and jason in turn named rochelle for being unable to control her nerves then ramsay announced that rochelle would be the first person going home and after ramsays words of compliments and encouragement the last person to give up her jacket he then announced that scott and jason would be advancing to the finals which meant that melanie was going home ramsay complimented melanie on her performance allowing her to keep her jacket 
 
as winner of the challenge scott has first choice in drafting a team using the ten eliminated chefs from the competition scotts picks are chris ralph rochelle kashia and jessica jasons picks are anton melanie gabriel bev and sandra who as the last remaining contestant to be picked was forced to be chosen by jason by default much to his disdain

after repelling narutos super mini-tailed beast ball while chiding obito for deviating from the plan including the method of his resurrection madara decides to take matters into his own hands to capture the remaining tailed beasts by using the first hokages wooden dragon to bind kurama and gyuki meanwhile kakashi tries to understand obitos reasons but is severely drained from overusing his sharingan as he gets endlessly pummeled luckily while stopping madaras susanoo from killing him killer bee and guy naruto uses a shadow clone to save kakashi hearing narutos words as an allusion to obitos childhood ideals kakashi gains the resolve to protect his student convincing naruto to let him control his body for a bit kurama reinvigorates kakashi with a chakra boost and tricked obito into warping the copy ninja into the other dimension so he can lose his advantage through kamui afterwards as gyuki attempts to break through the gedo statues barrier naruto turns his attention to the gedo statue as he and killer bee use two tailed beast bombs in hopes to destroy the statue before its regeneration into the ten-tails is complete despite the apparent victory the revived ten-tails appears from the fading smoke  
following the ten-tails arrival obito and madara quickly attach themselves to it and launch an attack against naruto and the others however kurama quickly takes charge of the situation and uses a strategy with kakashi to deliver gyuki close enough to the ten-tails to launch a tailed beast ball at point blank range however the ten-tails proves to be much to powerful for the pair of tailed beasts forcing them to retreat into their hosts and leaving naruto kakashi and guy at the mercy of its own tailed beast ball however the allied shinobi forces make a grand appearance with ino and hinata able to deflect the attack with their arrival naruto boldly proclaims to madara that their allied shinobi forces jutsu is more powerful than the infinite tsukuyomi also prompting obito to join the argument meanwhile shikaku uses the opportunity to develop a strategy involving the shinobi forces which he eventually relays with the help of inochi and they are able to immobilize the ten-tails inside a pit of concrete finally as the shinobi alliance charges at madara and obito the ten-tails begins undergoing a metamorphosis  
in the midst of the allied shinobi forces attack the ten-tails undergoes a sudden transformation which allows it to easily repel the attack as well as escape from the concrete pit madara and obito then begin launching tailed-beast balls in all directions eventually targeting the allied hq realizing the inevitable shikaku has inoichi relay one final plan to the alliance in order to stop madara and obito before the hq is annihilated afterwards madara outlines his plan to become the ten-tails jinchūriki to obito before the latter has the ten-tails launch a barrage of wooden spikes at the alliance killing countless more shinobi and also resulting in neji receiving a fatal wound after defending naruto as neji dies in narutos arms obito uses the opportunity to demoralize naruto however hinata with support from kurama steps in and boosts narutos morale afterwards obito recklessly launches a close-ranged tailed-beast ball which is repelled by the recovered bee finally drawing strength from the bonds he has made naruto prepares for a counterattack whilst infusing hinata with kuramas chakra  
naruto follows the strategy which shikaku relayed to him before his death to share kuramas chakra with his comrades and hence make the allied shinobi forces much stronger than before using their newly gained powers the allied forces corner the ten-tails and manage to sever obito and madaras bond with it meanwhile sasuke orochimaru jugo and suigetsu sneak into the konoha and enter the uchihas nakano shrine where orochimaru breaks the reaper death seal and performs the reanimation jutsu to reanimate all of the previous hokages  
having been reanimated by orochimaru the previous hokages immediately suspect the former to be up to his old schemes until he adds that they were brought solely to answer sasukes questions sasuke wastes no time in getting hiruzen to confirm the truth about itachi and follows up by questioning tobirama on the uchiha clan where the latter explains that the power of the sharingan manifests when a clan member experiences deep emotional trauma which in turn gives rise to hatred afterwards orochimaru tells the hokages of the ongoing war and when tobirama tries to leave orochimaru threatens to use them to attack the leaf village if they fail to appease sasukes questions afterwards sasuke asks hashirama to explain the concepts of a village and shinobi realizing that his answer would influence sasukes actions hashirama decides to begin his explanation by recounting his final climatic battle with madara at the valley of the end  
hashirama continues to tell his story telling of when he first met madara at a river when they were children during a time where ninja were without villages and hired by feudal lords for numerous bloody conflicts the two bond over their hardships of losing brothers in the fighting and their mutual dream to end the wars and create peace however hashiramas father butsuma finds out about their meetings and reveals to his son that madara is an uchiha and orders him to spy on him  
during the next meeting between hashirama and madara the two try to warn each other that their families are after them but when butsuma and tobirama arrive at the same time as madaras brother izuna and their father tajima and the confrontation leads to izuna almost being killed madara accepts the reality they live in and agrees to continue fighting against the senju as the years pass hashirama and madara become the leaders of their respective clans as the conflict between their families continues with many casualties during one such battle tobirama fatally wounds izuna the next time the senju brothers encounter madara in a later battle he informs them that izuna had succumbed to his injuries and had left him his eyes to continue protecting their clan but despite having acquired the eternal mangekyō sharingan madara is still defeated by hashirama stopping tobirama from delivering the final blow hashirama makes another attempt to offer madara peace but madara tells him that he will accept if hashirama takes his own life or tobiramas hashirama agrees and has his kin swear that the feud between their clans will end and that no harm will come to the uchiha after his death however seeing his former friends resolve madara stops hashirama from taking his life and accepts his proposal with peace between the senju and the uchiha the establishment of konoha soon follows  
with the uchiha and the senju clans forming an alliance madara and hashiramas childhood dream of a village where children were not sent to battle has come to fruition the village itself would ally with the land of fire having heard of his elder brothers intentions to choose madara as the hokage tobirama argues that things are done democratically now and everyone even the uchiha would not see madara in the same light as hashirama madara brings hashirama to the naka shrine and tells him that he intends to leave the village not understanding madaras true agenda hashirama attempts to persuade him to not leave the village but is unsuccessful and after leaving konoha madara continues to attack it and destroy his previous dream  
the battle between hashirama and madara concludes with hashirama killing madara and resolving himself to endure in order to protect his dream back in present day after hearing hashiramas story and reflecting on itachis life sasuke decides that the village that itachi sacrificed his life to protect should not be wasted and decides to enter the battlefield to follow his will after karin joins back up with them the resurrected hokage prepare to head to the battlefield  
as he continues defending his comrades from obito and madaras various attacks naruto begins to tire from micromanaging kuramas chakra the ten-tails begins going through another transformation and begins to perform a massive attack kakashi attempts to stop it with his kamui before he is intercepted by obito and the two go to the other dimension the ten-tailss technique causes massive destruction yet the shinobi survive thanks to naruto unfortunately naruto is worned out injured leaves nine-tails chakra mode and causes the cloaks of the alliance to fade away meanwhile kakashi gains the upper hand against obito aiming his lightning blade at him but stops due to not wanting to kill his former teammate kakashi tries to persuade him into reverting to how he was before but is taunted in response obito reveals that he is aware of the true story of rins death being that mist ninjas planned to use her to unleash the three-tails on konoha and she purposely made herself to die by kakashis hand to protect her village he uses genjutsu to show kakashi that his heart is empty and how infinite tsukuyomi can save people from this the ten-tails begins preparing a large tailed beast ball much to the horror of the alliance  
ten-tails fires his enormous tailed beast ball to the alliance shikamaru with the help of inos jutsu devises a last-minute plan to counter its powerful attack by creating a earth barrier and bee to slow down the tailed beast ball to change its trajectory however it manages to pierce through barriers of the alliance and bee quickly blocks its on his own the ball suddenly disappeared as minato arrives telling the alliance that he teleported it to the sea the other hokages soon arrive and create a special barrier to trap the ten tails sasuke arrives much to the shock of konoha 11 when he tells them that he is decided to protect the village and aspires to become hokage reuniting with naruto and sakura team 7 prepare themselves against the ten tails meanwhile in kamuis dimension obito continues to berate kakashi about the frailing reality in this world and value of comrades but kakashi tells obito that losing the feelings of his comrades are much worst than trash and he believes that his comrades will fill the hole inside his heart  
as the newly reformed team 7 mobilizes to battle the ten tails creates an army of monsters to defend himself from the attack sakura recalls her previous missions as she thought she is being left out due to the immense competition of naruto and sasuke and pursues to become capable like them her training with tsunade made her stronger and learned one of tsunades jutsu to amplify her strength back on the battle with the monsters of ten tails teams 8 and 10 make resolve for themselves to become stronger as well but ten tails constantly creates bigger and powerful monsters which hashirama notes sai who is also determined to become capable and stronger decides to attack ten tails head by himself but is unsuccessful and quickly saved by naruto sai discloses his worries about having to cover too much ground between the alliance and the main body of the ten tails and in response naruto sasuke and sakura summon gamakichi aoda and katsuyu respectively to help on the battlefield  
while sakura uses katsuyu to heal the injured members of the alliance naruto and gamakichi jump over the ten tails army of monsters while sasuke and aoda push through it combining two of their strongest techniques into one attack the two manage to deal a powerful blow to the ten-tails meanwhile orochimaru suigetsu and karin arrive at the battlefield where madara fought the five kage where tsunade is using katsuyu to heal the other kage but is too weak from her own injuries to make much progress suigetsu and karin reluctantly help tsunade recover and tsunade is shocked to learn that orochimaru is alive and helping to save her life orochimaru suigetsu and karin leave to join the main battle while tsunade stays behind to revive the remaining kage  
as allied shinobi forces watch the ten-tails burn naruto wanting to extract the tailed beasts from it sasuke reveals his intention to completely destroy the ten tails but the monster severs the burning part of its body to escape death back in the other dimension after his battle with kakashi ends with them impaling each other with their attacks obito warps back to the battlefield seeing obito return to their reality lamenting not fighting hashirama prior and that his apprentice outlived his purpose madara forces obito to use the samsara of heavenly life so he can be resurrected and become the ten tails jinchuriki producing a shadow clone to help naruto and sasuke stop obito while hashirama and tobirama deal with madara minato learns his former apprentice was the masked ninja from the night of his death but matters worsen when obito reveals he retained control of himself as he frees the ten tails before absorbing it to become a jinchuriki  
months prior to sasuke defeating him orochimaru conducts an experiment where he used lightning to bring a robotic being to life but he and kabuto were forced to evacuate when the robot goes berserk and begins to destroy the building the following day the robot is found by itachi and kisame with pain repairing it before he instructs itachi to use the robot to capture naruto sent into konoha the robot begins its search for naruto while attacking several villagers and defeating team guy naruto himself shows up to stop the robot so that he can get back to training his clones easily repelled yet manages to force the robots cloak off the robot is then revealed to be a mechanical replica of naruto whom is named mecha-naruto mecha-naruto begins siphoning narutos nine tails chakra causing naruto to lose his strength kakashi and yamato arrive with the former distracting mecha-naruto with his lightning blade giving yamato the opportunity to save naruto the trio manage to escape using a secret tunnel and mecha naruto responds by destroying the village in an effort to find naruto in the hokages office tsunade devises a plan to lure mecha-naruto away from the village naruto rides away from the village in a palanquin with yamato while choji kiba neji and shikamaru act as bearers and kakashi as backup the plan is put into action and mecha-naruto starts pursuing the palanquin shino not wanting to be left behind like last time attempts to distract mecha naruto before being defeated the group decides to escape into the forest with shikamaru switching places with kakashi in a futile attempt to defeat mecha-naruto back at konoha tsunade orders shizune to request assistance from the hidden sand  
after mecha-naruto defeats shikamaru it intercepts the group by firing missiles forcing them to take a detour into the forest again with choji and kiba each attempting to take out the robot but are defeated when their strongest attacks countered eventually the palanquin falling over since no one was holding it in the front mecha-naruto attacks with neji fending off the robot with his eight trigrams palm rotation but mecha-naruto uses its amassed speed to counter nejis defense while knocking him and yamato out though kakashi decides to battle mecha-naruto he finds himself at a disadvantage against an enemy he cannot copy and quickly defeated with no more in its way mecha-naruto proceeds to extract the nine-tails from naruto before gaara appears however deidara appears and mocks gaara into pursuing him to settle things but things worsen when orochimaru summons a snakes stomach around naruto and his opponent revealing himself as mecha-narutos creator while reprograming the robot to obey him but jiraiya and gamabunta arrive to free naruto before orochimaru takes the two out things appeared hopeless until naruto states that he will not give in until he saves sasuke activating a program that itachi secretly inserted into mecha-naruto now aiding naruto mecha-naruto turns on orochimaru before his creator bisects him in half orochimaru then proceeds to activate a switch summoning a giant robot version of the nine-tails to destroy konoha mecha-naruto encases itself onto naruto like a suit and both of them fly to konoha to defeat the mecha nine-tails but their attacks have no effect however ejecting naruto prior mecha-naruto decides to sacrifice itself to destroy the mecha nine-tails by using the leftover nine-tails chakra to fire its tailed beast cannon which destroys both robots the villagers celebrate narutos victory and the side story ends with the village being comically drowned in gaaras sand tsunami  
as the other allied shinobi wonder about the ten-tailss sudden disappearance hinata explains to sakura that the monsters body and chakra were completely absorbed by obito who became a jinchuriki rather than perform the rinne rebirth for madara with him and tobirama noting the new threat hashirama attempts to pin obito however hashiramas restraints prove useless against obito as he destroys the hokages barrier with his chakra arms as minato tries to call out to his former student and hashirama unable to avoid an impatient madara the other reanimated hokage start attacking the enemy by using their indestructible bodies to study obitos power such as his ability to blend multiple chakra natures to produce a multipurpose substance minato goes on the front trying to exploit obitos inability to suppress the ten-tails only for obito to dodge and grab naruto and sasuke by their necks luckily naruto uses his chakra arms to enable minato to teleport him and sasuke to safety as obito begins to suffer the side effects of the ten-tails inside his body realizing obito is open to attack minato decides to make his move with naruto and sasuke following however though his consciousness is being ripped apart by the ten-tails obito uses his memories of rin and team minato to assert full control and assume a new form similar to the sage of the six paths now in full control of himself obito forces minato to teleport back after ripping the fourth hokages arm off but sasuke and naruto then noticed that obito had attached some of the mysterious substance on minatos person which is about to detonate  
minato was about to teleport naruto and sasuke away from him when tobirama uses a shadow clone to take the detonating truth seeking ball back to obito who shields himself from the explosion meanwhile the allied shinobi are intimidated while witnessing the god-like battle between madara and hashirama until shikamaru uplifts their morale while telling them that because no matter how little power they have in comparison to the legendary ninja even the smallest opening could be exploited after readjusting their plan of attack naruto and sasuke combine their techniques to create an opening but tobirama and minato strategically use their flying raijin techniques so that the scorch style nimbus tempest instead hits obito but obito emerges from the flames unscathed as it is revealed that the truth seeking balls contain yin-yang chakra that negates the regenerative abilities of reanimated ninja matters are worsened when narutos nine tails chakra mode runs out while gamakichi makes an attack on obito with his starch syrup gun before the summoning jutsu expires from there obito berates the title of hokage but having saw the effect of gamakichis attack on obitos barrier while angered by obitos words naruto with the help of tobirama successfully lands a senjutsu rasengan on obitos back minato amazes on naruto becoming a sage like jiraiya before being suddenly contacted by yin kurama who reminds him that naruto did manage to befriend his other half  
yin-kurama asks minato whether he intended to let naruto clean up after him telling him to not to blame himself from his wifes death and that making his son the jinchuriki of kuramas yang half turned out good now seeing that he could not be careless now that naruto found a means to injure him obito decides to casually begin project tsuki no me by creating a giant flowering tree to wipe out the remaining allied shinobi with four tailed beast balls furthermore with hashirama giving the shinobi alliance a plan through a wood clone as he cannot talk madara into a momentary ceasefire to help them directly everybody is fenced in by obitos barrier so that they would not escape luckily on a gambit naruto comes up with his own plan and asks minato to bump fists with him so their respective kuramas can connect through them obito wraps himself in a protective cloak still berating minato by reminding him that tomorrow is the anniversary of both his death and that of kushina but naruto injects that the day is birthday while minato marvels at his grown-up sons courage once naruto and minato fist-bump the allied shinobi chakra cloaks are rekindled by kuramas chakra in its entirety after naruto provides sasuke and jugo with chakra cloaks tobirama seeing the boys chakra dispersal similar to the shadow clone jutsu that he created in his lifetime minato uses his sons connection to everyone to teleport them all outside of the barrier when minato uses this reprieve so he can tell naruto his feelings the youth explains it not necessary as both his father and kushina already conveyed their feelings to him through their chakra imprints  
with the allied shinobi teleported to safety kurama allows naruto to use sage mode with his chakra and assumes tailed beast mode as he and minato attack obito with renewed vigor under both kuramas advice naruto and minato fully manifest the foxes as they use a senjutsu rasengan on obito but the attack has no effect as obito releases the ten tails and has it assume its true form a giant tree whose roots fatally drain caught shinobi of their chakra shocked that obito is actually carrying out project tsuki no me madara reveals to hashirama that the ten tails was originally the source of all chakra in the world the shinju madara proceeds to explain a legend of a princess named kaguya otsutsuki eating the chakra-rich fruit of the shinju to end an epic war ages ago and that the once neutral tree transformed into an embodiment of its wrath after the birth of kaguyas son the first human born with chakra who would become the sage of the six paths as naruto is saved from the shinjus roots by hiruzen madara tells hashirama that he learned the legend from the stone tablet while explaining that the shinju will could bring the uchiha clans future as its time of blooming will be the moment the infinite tsukuyomi begins  
on gaaras sand as they make towards the battlefield the kage see the shinju and katsuyu proceeds to explain the current situation on ground as the medical ninja come to shikamarus aid after barely surviving the shinju and all of katsuyus extensions have been killed off naruto mourns the numerous deaths as obito attempts to break his will once again while offering to spare those among the surviving allied ninja who would no longer resist the infinite tsukiyomi but as his wood clone tells the allied ninja not to give in as orochimaru arrives alongside suigetsu and karin hashirama continue battling madara as the uchiha intending to take obitos place once the time comes reveals that the shinju will bloom within fifteen minutes hashirama then relays the information to everyone via inos mind transmission to booster the allied ninjas morale and not to give up after a susanoo-clad sasuke asks him if he had reached his limit while cutting off one of the shinjus branches naruto enters sage tailed beast mode and his thoughts of not losing anyone else ever again are conveyed to everyone through inos jutsu not wanting to be outdone sasuke has jugo infuse his susanoo with natural energy to join naruto in fighting obito but when hashirama notices the allied ninja still having doubts he has ino show everyone his memories of the first summit of the five kage where he told the kage of his time of his dream – to unite the shinobi world with hashirama renewing their determination the allied ninja prepare themselves for battle as the five kage arrive to the battlefield all standing on a united front as the first hokages dream is realized  
as the five kage arrive to the battlefield they note that this is no battle to be lost meanwhile naruto and sasuke clash against obito as sakura continues to heal shikamaru his treatment progresses little but sakura promises not to let him die just then narutos version 1 cloak encases shikamaru which ino notes was being done subconsciously as an extension of narutos will shikamaru finally regains some strength and tsunade arrives completely healing shikamaru while praising sakura that she has done well after speaking briefly with her grandfather tsunade and the other kage rally all the troops around them elsewhere in kamuis dimension kakashi is almost ready to return to the battlefield once more the alliance then move out to destroy the ten-tails tree form responding to his senseis question orochimaru decides to take part as well and proceeds to attack the ten-tails with his snakes while hiruzen destroys one of its branches with enmas staff form tsunade and sakura attempt to summon one tenth of katsuyu to aid in the recovery of the alliance by using their seals together naruto and sasuke continue their clash with obito who easily evades all of their attacks noting its time for them to sleep obito grabs the duo using chakra arms naruto and sasuke are forced out of their sage tailed beast mode and susanoo completely as obito demands to know why naruto still fights he proudly states that never going back on his word is his nindō naruto declares that he will sleep tomorrow and dream on his own as sasukes susanoo encases narutos tailed beast mode elsewhere in kamuis dimension while realizing that obito still possesses his will of fire despite his hatred kakashi prepares to return to their reality  
sasukes susanoo equips itself onto narutos sage tailed beast mode obito manifests a large shield and the sword of nunoboko which the sage of the six paths used to shape the world naruto creates nine rasengans in kuramas tails and calls for his comrades to join the fray each of them jump into kuramas tails and are donned in tailed beast mode mantle they then launch the rasengan at obito making way for naruto and sasuke to slash through his defence and land a devastating blow this results in all of the tailed beasts chakra being pulled out of obito naruto begins the great tug-of-war against obito who struggles desperately to retain the chakra of the beasts gaara and killer b assist naruto and try to pull out the chakra of their respective tailed beasts the remainder of the konoha 11 as well as the shinobi alliance all join in the effort and begin to pull within his subconscious obito witnesses the allied shinobi forces in front of him as naruto talks to him obito begins to regrets his actions imagining how things would be had he been hokage naruto boldly declares that he is obito uchiha and will remove his mask once and for all

doflamingo lies to the shocked citizens that witnessed him shooting law telling them that law was actually responsible for the mornings fake news about doflamingo leaving the throne when asked by luffy what he is doing with his ally doflamingo responds that law was originally his subordinate and that it was his responsibility to educate him zoro and kinemon attempt to save law but before the marines make a move to stop them admiral fujitora appears blocks zoros sword and sends him underground using his ability luffy tries to help but is blocked by the colosseums bars which are made of sea prism stone the rest of the crew who were listening to the events are shocked to learn that doflamingo has an admiral on his side fujitora and doflamingo pick up law and head for the palace in order to finish their conversation zoro tells luffy to find a way out as they try to outrun the marines at that point sanjis group is attacked by what appears to be a singing ship which belongs to big mom on the ship are tamago and pekoms who reveal that their goal is caesar clown the straw hats realize they have to keep their new enemies away from dressrosa if they want to destroy the factory luffy gives the order for the sunny to head to zou sanji asks permission to return fire to the yonkos ship and franky leads the way for the factory destruction team finally luffy states in anger that they will head to the palace to save law and defeat doflamingo meanwhile a mysterious figure enters the colosseum

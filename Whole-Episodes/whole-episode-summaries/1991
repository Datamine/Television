 japan 
gohan and the others are captured by a band of space pirates for they think they are the lackies of a villain named frieza who sent some of his forces to take over their planet long ago suddenly the station heads into an asteroid field and bulma runs toward the cockpit she pushes the pilot out of the way and guides the ship out of the asteroids safely after realizing that theyre not enemies the pirates let gohan krillin and bulma go  
thanks to the kids help bulma uses a shortcut to get to namek after a crash landing on the planets surface two namekians nurse them back to health they offer to help the three in their search for the dragon balls  
as they continue their search for the dragon balls with the namekians help they get closer and closer to attaining all seven back on earth goku escapes from the hospital and begins training meanwhile vegetas ship has reached its destination and doctors have begun their work on him  
gohan krillin and bulma are one dragon ball away from making their wish but during their search for the seventh dragon ball their two namekian friends reveal that they are not namekians at all in fact theyre not even on namek meanwhile vegeta learns that frieza has traveled to namek to gather the dragon balls not wanting to be beaten to the punch vegeta immediately blasts off for namek  
the two namekians reveal that they have been stuck on this planet since their ship broke down and they have been planning to steal bulmas ship they read their minds after her ship crashed and so they projected images of namekians over their true forms gohan bulma and krillin however are able to escape the clutches of the two aliens and continue their trip to namek after a long journey gohan and the others celebrate their arrival on namek but their party is cut short by the arrival of vegeta however hes not even their worst problem because frieza is also on namek  
frieza and his henchmen are already in possession of four dragon balls freiza has learned of vegetas arrival so he sends one of his henchmen cui after him meanwhile gohan and krillin sees two of friezas henchmen looking for the dragon balls but they get beaten up easily cui believes that he is stronger than vegeta but hasnt calculated vegetas power after his time on earth the two engage in battle but cui is destroyed effortlessly  
with bulma safely hiding in a cave gohan and krillin fly to the nearby namek village to investigate crouching behind a rock they see frieza and his henchmen trying to steal the fifth dragon ball back on earth master roshi tells goku everything that happened on namek and asks for gokus help but hes still not healed yet yajirobe arrives with a bag of senzu beans for goku now that hes healed he flies to capsule corp where dr brief has made a replica of his spaceship which includes a gravity chamber to train in on his way to namek goku immediately blasts off for namek  
the evil frieza and his henchmen try to persuade the namekian elder of the village to hand over the dragon ball by killing most of the villagers gohan who cant watch the innocent namekians get murdered anymore is about to fly in and save them when three more namekians appear these three are strong enough to defeat friezas weaker henchmen so the evil tyrant sends one of his best fighters dodoria after them  
dodoria steps in to fight and he easily kills the namekian warriors with no other choice the elder gives the fifth ball to frieza but despite his cooperation he and the namekian boy cargo are killed before dodoria can finish off the last namekian boy gohan loses control and steps in to save him he grabs the boy and takes off with krillin at his side dodoria speeds off after them  
by using tiens solar flare technique krillin gohan and the namekian boy dende are able to escape from dodoria as the pink alien tries to get back to frieza vegeta shows up ready to settle the score between him and dodoria dodoria is taken by surprise by vegetas new strength and the saiyan prince easily overpowers him pleading for his life dodoria barters information for his freedom he tells vegeta that it was actually frieza not an asteroid that destroyed planet vegeta although taken aback at this new revelation he kills dodoria anyway  
with vegeta stronger and frieza afoot krillin is having doubts if he and the others will be able to collect the dragon balls bulma hears from her father that goku is already on his way to namek meanwhile goku is training aboard his spaceship at 20x the earths gravity suddenly an asteroid collides with his ship which aims it directly into a star goku is forced to summon every ounce of strength that he has in order to blast his ship back on course no longer needing a scouter to sense energy vegeta quickly finds the next dragon ball for good measure he wipes out the entire village as well he then hides the dragon ball in the water nearby for safekeeping sensing the nearby destruction krillin and gohan deduce that vegeta has found the sixth dragon ball  
with only one left dende and krillin take off toward the namekian leader guru it is this eldest namekian who holds the seventh dragon ball meanwhile king kai tells goku that his friends have made it to his place and to not face frieza  
as goku steps up his training king kai tells him that yamcha tien chiaotzu and piccolo have come to train with him however king kai has discovered that frieza is on namek and warns goku not go near him back on namek as krillin and dende head towards the eldest namek zarbon one of friezas high-level henchmen finds vegeta and intends to destroy him vegeta shows off his newfound strength by easily beating him up however zarbon claims he has a trick up his sleeve  
realizing he is no match for vegetas increased power zarbon has no choice but to reveal his true power transforming into a hideous reptilian beast in this form he is far more powerful and begins to pound vegeta with a mighty stroke he blasts vegeta to the bottom of a lake and he is presumed dead  
once they finally arrive at their destination krillin and dende meet the eldest namek guru and his bodyguard nail who closely resembles piccolo the wise old namekian gives krillin the last dragon ball and upon seeing that he is pure-hearted unlike frieza also awakens hidden powers within him as krillin heads back to the others zarbon informs frieza that he killed vegeta when frieza finds out that zarbon only assumes that vegeta is dead he makes him go back and find vegeta zarbon arrives at their battle site pulls vegeta out of the water and brings him back to friezas ship dende arrives and tells nail what has happened  
as goku trains harder for namek yamcha tien and chiaotzu complete king kais first test even piccolo helps out on the second test back on namek friezas men are working to revive vegeta but hes still unconscious from his battle with zarbon meanwhile krillin is still on his way back to gohan and bulma  
vegeta has recovered and with no one watching him he breaks out of his medical chamber and hides he creates a diversion to get frieza and zarbon away from the five dragon balls he goes into the main control room that contains the dragon balls blasts a hole in the ship and escapes furious over the loss of the dragon balls frieza orders zarbon to find vegeta and the dragon balls in one hour or he will die vegeta finds a suitable hiding spot for the five dragon balls he knows that frieza and his henchmen have no scouters and cant sense energy signals so they wont be able to find the five balls without combing the entire surface of the planet  
gohan suddenly senses an energy signal from the village that vegeta destroyed earlier and goes to check it out krillin arrives back at the cave to give bulma the good news however zarbon and vegeta followed him they see that he has a dragon ball and they decide to fight each other for it zarbon thinks that the fight will be as easy as it was the last time but he doesnt know that a saiyans strength increases after he recovers from injury and vegeta makes short work of him he then takes krillins dragon ball back to where he hid the other five meanwhile gokus ship hits a magnetic storm which makes the gravity machine malfunction causing it to increase the gravity to 100x normal though he can barely move goku sees this as a new challenge and begins to train under the intense gravity  
with both of his main henchmen killed by vegeta frieza summons his elite fighting squad the ginyu force meanwhile gohan finds the dragon ball vegeta hid underwater and heads back to the cave with it however he notices vegeta on his way back and drops to the ground hiding until vegeta threatens to blow the surrounding area to pieces gohan reveals himself and is able to keep vegeta from realizing that the last dragon ball is hiding right behind him amazed at his luck gohan brings the dragon ball back to krillin and bulma he and krillin then take off toward gurus place leaving the dragon ball in bulmas possession they hope that guru will awaken gohans hidden power vegeta returns to the village and discovers his dragon ball is missing and realizes that gohan had taken it also he draws a conclusion about the dragon radar furious he returns to the cave but was too late as gohan krillin and bulma had already left  
as gohan and krillin head to gurus place to awaken gohans hidden powers they leave bulma behind to look after the dragon ball frustrated at his loss of five of the dragon balls frieza begins firing powerful energy blasts all over the surface of namek these explosions cause the dragon ball to roll away from bulma and into the water nearby bulma takes her submarine into the water to find the lost ball but there she finds more than she bargained for as she reaches for the ball a giant crab thinks she is trying to steal her eggs and begins to attack bulma bulma saves the crab from a falling rock and the crab gives her the dragon ball  
bulma finally retrieves the dragon ball only to be captured by two of friezas henchmen she persuades them into find the rest of the dragon balls and making a wish themselves knowing she has more dragon ball knowledge than the two of them they take her along she leads them into the water and right to the giant crab who eats both of them  
krillin and gohan finally make it to gurus place but vegeta has followed them determined to get the last dragon ball as krillin tries to hold off vegeta gohan has his hidden powers unleashed suddenly they all sense an incredibly powerful force arriving on the planet vegeta recognizes it as the ginyu force he tells krillin and gohan that the ginyu force is far more powerful even than he is vegeta says that if they are to defeat them and prevent frieza from making his wish they must work together  
the ginyu force arrives on namek they are five incredibly powerful warriors named guldo jeice recoome burter and captain ginyu these five fighters specialize in making flashy poses frieza tells them what the dragon balls are and sends them after vegeta he tells captain ginyu to use his scouter to find the dragon balls while the other four deal with vegeta meanwhile krillin is very reluctant to join forces with vegeta but gohan knows that goku would do it so he convinces krillin to help the ginyu force quickly finds where vegeta and the others are and are prepared to fight  
the weakest member of the ginyu force guldo steps up to fight against the powered up krillin and gohan guldo quickly discovers that both krillin and gohan are far more powerful than he is so he uses his special technique he holds his breath stopping time krillin and gohan swoop in for the final blow several times but every time guldo stops time and runs to a different location he then reveals another trick he uses his mysterious power to completely bind krillin and gohan unable to move they are at the mercy of guldo having seen enough vegeta steps in and quickly annihilates guldo  
the next fighter from the ginyu force is the massive recoome vegeta pulls out all the stops but he is no match for recoome the giant begins to toy with vegeta despite the pleas from the remaining members of the ginyu force with vegeta out of commission krillin steps in to save him though he does his best he is easily defeated  
since krillin and vegeta cant fight anymore gohan is the only one left to fight captain ginyu leader of the force locates all seven dragon balls and brings them to frieza frieza tries to make his wish but realizes he doesnt know what to do he figures there must be a password meanwhile gohan gives it everything he has against recoome but the giant warrior is too strong just as he is about to finish off gohan everyone senses a gigantic power arriving on the planet krillin gohan and vegeta realize it is goku  
goku has finally arrived on namek and finds krillin gohan and vegeta near death he gives them all a senzu bean and prepares to fight the ginyu force with a single blow to the gut he puts recoome out of commission gokus training at 100x normal gravity has exponentially increased his strength  
with recoome beaten by one punch the remaining two ginyu force members burter and jeice fight against goku but none of their speed attacks work against him they try to hit him but their punches seem to go through goku he is dodging so fast that it appears he isnt even moving vegeta believes that goku has become the legendary saiyan warrior the super saiyan if this is true goku would be the first super saiyan in millennia  
goku easily beats burter frightened jeice flies away to get captain ginyu vegeta then executes both recoome and burter despite gokus pleas meanwhile frieza heads off towards gurus place hoping to discover the secret to using the dragon balls goku vegeta krillin and gohan all sense that frieza is on the move but the dragon balls remain in their place they recognize that this might be their only chance to make their wish  
once captain ginyu arrives vegeta leaves goku behind to get the dragon balls for himself krillin and gohan leave to get the dragon radar from bulma so they can find the balls before vegeta jeice tells captain ginyu how powerful goku is but the captain is confident he can beat him goku decides to skip the warmup and power up to his full strength immediately as he is powering up jeice measures his power level on his scanner he is shocked as the level continues to climb higher and higher eventually surpassing captain ginyus maximum captain ginyu doesnt believe the scanner and begins to fight with goku  
goku is obviously more powerful than ginyu but the captain wont give up so easily meanwhile guru sends dende to tell krillin and gohan the password to use the dragon balls frieza arrives at gurus place demanding to know the dragon balls password the last three namekians arrive as well but despite nails pleas they about to fight frieza but the tyrant easily kills them though nail informs him that the dragon balls would disappear following gurus death frieza confronts guru to get the password anyway  
nail leads frieza away from gurus place so that he cant get hurt he starts fighting frieza but it seems that he was unable to hold him up though he does to give time for dende to deliver the dragon balls password to  gohan and krillin get the dragon radar from bulma and head towards friezas spaceship meanwhile goku is winning his fight against captain ginyu realizing he cant win captain ginyu decides to use his special power the body change he severely wounded himself to gokus horror and shoots a beam of light out of his mouth and into gokus the two switch bodies ginyu as goku then flies back towards friezas spaceship leaving goku in ginyus thrashed body behind  
krillin and gohan arrive at friezas spaceship and locate the dragon balls unaware that vegeta is not far away as the two try to figure out what the password is jeice and captain ginyu in gokus body arrive as well the disguised ginyu tries to trick krillin into believing that he is goku gohan however realizes that it is not the real goku goku in captain ginyus destroyed body arrives and tells krillin and gohan what happened now it is up to gohan to defeat captain ginyu  
ginyu tries to power up with gokus body but it turns out what gokus right was that he cant reach its full potential because he doesnt know how to unite body and mind but even at a relatively low power he can still overpower both krillin and gohan vegeta arrives and begins to fight jeice having recovered from severe injury vegeta has greatly increased his power and easily overpowers and kills jeice  
realizing that hes no match for the renewed vegeta captain ginyu decides to use his body-switching trick on him once again he lets his body get thrashed so his opponent will be very weak after the switch just as captain ginyu uses the trick goku recognizes the move and intercepts the light beam switching back into his old body back in his broken body captain ginyu tries to switch with vegeta again goku throws a frog to intercept the transfer the frog in ginyus body hops into the water while ginyu in the frogs body flees with the ginyu force defeated goku recovers in an isolation chamber in friezas spaceship vegeta finds two pairs of saiyan armor for krillin and gohan to wear in their upcoming fight with frieza  


 japan 
while goku is recovering krillin heads to gurus to get the password gohan is left behind to guard the dragon balls while vegeta is taking a nap on his way to gurus krillin sees dende flying in the opposite direction he meets up with him and dende tells him that he has been sent to deliver the password krillin and dende head back to friezas ship once they arrive they decide to make the wish now so vegeta wont get his wish of immortality they bring the dragon balls to a nearby island and dende summons porunga frieza meanwhile realizes that nail is purposely stalling him he makes a move to finish him off nail however says that killing him wont do any good because the others probably already have summoned the dragon balls as the sky suddenly turns black frieza realizes that someone must be summoning the dragon and frantically flies back to his ship  
thanks to dende the eternal dragon porunga has been summoned unlike shenron the earths dragon porunga has the power to grant three wishes through king kai piccolo tells gohan to use the first wish to bring him back to life then use the second to bring him to namek the dragon grants these two wishes while they are thinking of their third wish vegeta wakes up furious he flies over to gohan krillin and dende demanding that they wish for his immortality before they can decide what to do porunga suddenly disappears guru has died so the dragon balls and porunga die with him  
guru is gone along with porunga and vegetas wish frieza arrives furious at being denied his wish he begins to fight with them vegeta is confident in his new strength meanwhile piccolo comes upon nails wounded body nail tells him to fuse with him because this transformation might give him enough power to defeat frieza though he is reluctant piccolo agrees he and nail become one though it is in piccolos body with his newfound strength piccolo continues towards friezas ship  
as the battle continues frieza decides to tell vegeta that it was actually he who destroyed planet vegeta wiping out the saiyan race vegeta claims that he knew all along which was why he hated frieza so much frieza decides to reveal another secret he can transform he claims that at full strength his fighting power is over one million eager to finally destroy vegeta frieza transforms into a hideous giant  
by transforming into a giant frieza has gained much more power friezas first victim is krillin after seeing his friend attacked gohan loses control of himself and unleashes a furious attack on frieza though he is strong he is not strong enough to stop frieza who pounds the inexperienced young warrior  
dende heals krillins injuries krillin is then able to distract frieza long enough for dende to heal gohan though they are both back to full strength it all seems useless because none of them are a match for frieza suddenly piccolo finally arrives at the scene he tells them that he will take on frieza alone krillin and gohan dont understand why he would do this but piccolo insists with his new strength acquired from fusion he is confident that he can take down frieza  
piccolo and frieza begin to fight with his new power piccolo is able to hold his own with frieza also since he is fused with nail he is familiar with the way frieza fights inside the isolation chamber in friezas spaceship goku senses that piccolo has arrived and that his strength has dramatically increased it seems that piccolo is going to defeat frieza  
piccolo is beating frieza but the evil tyrant has another trick up his sleeve another transformation he changes into a hideous beast in this form frieza is even more powerful than before piccolo begins to fight the new frieza but it is clear that frieza is more powerful piccolo is no longer able to hold him off  
frieza is about to finish piccolo off but gohan jumps in front of his energy blast to save him he then fires a blast of his own at frieza but frieza is able to deflect it frieza decides to transform into his final form to finish them off once and for all vegeta however comes up with a plan to stop him he asks krillin to severely injure him but when dende heals him he will become much more powerful krillin reluctantly gives vegeta a powerful blast and the saiyan falls to the ground he stumbles over to dende demanding that he be healed though dende resists gohan and krillin convince him to do it  
frieza realizes that dende has been healing his opponents so he kills him now in his final form frieza seems unstoppable gohan and krillin throw everything theyve got at him but frieza easily defeates them vegeta steps in telling frieza that he has now become a super saiyan unafraid frieza takes him on  
despite his dramatic increase in power vegeta is no match for frieza it seems that he is not a super saiyan after all gohan krillin and piccolo helplessly look on in horror as frieza tortures vegeta luckily goku has finally recovered he breaks out of the isolation chamber and flies to the battlefield  
goku has entered the battlefield stronger than ever and prepares to fight frieza alone it seems that goku might become a super saiyan as he easily deflects friezas energy attacks as vegeta taunts frieza the tyrant easily finishes him off with a cruel bout of laughter with his last breath vegeta tells goku of what frieza has done to the saiyans can goku defeat frieza the one person no one else has beaten  
with new understanding of the saiyans goku vows to avenge them by defeating frieza both of these warriors match each others moves with great speed and strength then frieza fires at namek causing a volcanic eruption can goku survive this  
as the fight continues goku attacks from underwater upon realizing that frieza cant sense power levels as goku seems to be in control frieza uses his mind to use rocks to attack goku so he can trap him in an energy ball that will explode if it touches anything but frieza and it doesnt look good for goku  
to prove that hes the strongest of all frieza uses his feet and not his hands to beat goku it may seem frieza has the advantage but goku proves that the tyrant will have to use his hands meanwhile bulma finds a frog unaware that its captain ginyu as he prepares to switch bodies with her  
to ensure goku is defeated frieza powers up to 50% of his maximum and it seems that not even goku can handle it ginyu finds the other heroes in bulmas body and prepares to have his revenge  
captain ginyu prepares his revenge by switching with piccolo but gohan is able to throw bulma as a frog in the way to get her body back meanwhile goku is being beaten up by frieza with his power increase and even the kaio-ken attack doesnt work but as he is held by the monsters power he has a vision showing what frieza could do to earth rocked and inspired by the vision goku powers up  
gokus 20x kaio-ken attack with a kamehameha cannot work against frieza as the tyrant tries to destroy him once and for all luckily goku has one more trick up his sleeve the spirit bomb  
as king kai and the others watch the battle on namek the ginyu force arrives to take over the planet but yamcha tien and chiaotzu are ready for a fight back on namek frieza discovers gokus spirit bomb and plans to stop it suddenly piccolo steps in to give goku more time  
the battle on king kais planet begins with the z-fighters against the ginyu force and it seems that our heroes training is paying off piccolo does his best for goku to complete the spirit bomb but it seems that frieza might win this battle at the last moment the spirit bomb is completed and goku hurls it at frieza who cant control the force of the blast frieza is seemingly destroyed  
it looks like the battle is over as frieza seems to be defeated and the ginyu force has been beaten off king kais planet to hell by the remaining z-fighters as everyone celebrates frieza reappears and spares no time attacking first he fires a blast at goku but piccolo hurls himself in front of it and takes the blast knocking him out then frieza fires another blast and uses it to blow up krillin killing him fueled by rage at the loss of his best friend gokus power increases exponentially and he ascends to become a super saiyan  
gokus hair has turned gold and his eyes green as he is surrounded by a gold aura the fuel of this power being his anger towards frieza as gohan takes piccolo to gokus ship our hero starts to pound on frieza as the tyrant fires back but none of his attacks are working against goku now that he is a super saiyan it looks like frieza will finally be defeated  
not willing to be beaten frieza fires an attack to destroy namek so goku will be killed as the super saiyan cant do anything to stop the attack however he holds back too much power and the planet isnt destroyed but is left unstable and ready to collapse and blow up  
namek is about to explode in 5 minutes as gohan finds bulma and gets back to the ship meanwhile frieza powers up to 100% of his maximum to finish the fight instead of stopping him goku has let frieza go full power on the idea that if he beats frieza at his full power frieza will never fight him again as they continue their fight it seems that frieza has regained the upper hand now that he has powered up to his maximum but goku claims that the battle is far from over  
as the battle on namek continues kami and mr popo have found all of the restored dragon balls giving king kai an idea that might save everyone on namek  
everyone that has been killed by frieza and his henchmen on namek are resurrected but so far guru isnt back yet and it looks like goku has been beaten by friezas attack to avenge his father gohan returns to the battle to make sure that the cold tyrant dies along with the planet but is no match for frieza before frieza lands the killing blow however guru returns to life and goku reappears and orders gohan to leave namek  
with guru back to life the namekian dragon balls have been restored as well with porunga ready to grant the third wish as dende prepares to complete the final phase of king kais plan frieza flies towards porunga to have his wish granted as well can goku stop him in time  
it seems that everyone on namek has been transported to earth but goku is still on namek insisting that he finish the fight everyone is upset with gokus decision as it seems that there is no escape from the explosion  
as namek gets closer to an explosion it looks like goku can beat frieza with ease as frieza is getting weaker finally goku decides to leave stating that frieza has lost to a fighter superior to him but the tyrant wont give up that easily  
frieza fires a pair of krillins destructo disks that will follow goku until it hits him or anything else even so goku has the situation under control as the battle draws to a close end  
as guru enjoys seeing his people alive on earth the time has come for him to go but gave his powers to moori as the next eldest namek back on namek frieza has been cut in half by his own energy disk from behind but goku being the kind person he is gives frieza some of his power to escape however frieza will not accept defeat as he uses the given power to finish goku off but goku finishes off frieza with a final blast attack  
with frieza gone goku flies to friezas spaceship to escape from namek but to no avail even though it looks like goku is gone bulma and the others have an idea that could work using the namekian dragon balls once restored to bring everyone else back including goku  
as it looks like goku and krillin cant come back vegeta has an idea wish their souls to earth and then wish them back to life which is done for krillin yamcha is also brought back to life after another 130 days tien and chiaotzu are also back to life but porunga says goku cant be wished back to life because hes still alive and knew that he doesnt want to return to earth yet however goku will return some other time  


 japan 
even with goku not back yet the earth has been very peaceful as gohan fishes and krillin dates a young girl named maron however the peace will be disturbed because an old enemy has escaped from his dark prison- garlic jr  
garlic jr and his henchmen the spice boys have infiltrated kamis lookout and have captured kami and mr popo with garlic jr in control he releases his fathers black water mist- a vapor that unlocks any evil within a person becoming a demon can anyone withstand the mists power  
with their friends infected by the black water mist and the knowledge of garlic jrs return gohan and krillin head towards the lookout to get the sacred water but its going to be tricky with garlic jr beating them to the punch meanwhile piccolo handles the spice boys and the others but will he too be infected by the mist

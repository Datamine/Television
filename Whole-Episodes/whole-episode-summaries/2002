this episode originally aired after super bowl xxxvii on abc 
despite earning critical acclaim from usa today and attracting the largest audience of the series with 174 million viewers this episode retained just 19 percent of the super bowl xxxvii audience and has the dubious distinction of earning the lowest overall ratings for a program airing after a super bowl since at least 1987 and the lowest rating ever 83 rating in the age 18-49 demographic for a post-super bowl program much of this can be attributed to the fact that the episode didnt air until 11 pm on the east coast which also meant it was not eligible for the weeks list of top primetime shows ranked by nielsen media research and thus the episodes viewership numbers were not factored in the series overall 2002-2003 season average

after his sneak attack failed sasuke attempts to fight kakashi before being buried up to his neck in earth from there kakashi subjects sakura to a genjutsu of sasuke bleeding to death before dealing with naruto when he decides to help himself to everyones lunches once the time of the test is up naruto tied up to a pole kakashi deems all members of team 7 utter failures as he reveals that his test was unpassable because the three lacked skills in team work from there kakashi explains the essential need for ninja groups to work as a unit while stating his own ideal that while ninja who break the rules are scum those who abandon their friends are worse than scum from there kakashi offers to give team 7 one final chance and leaves them with one order to follow not to feed naruto however knowing that they need naruto at full strength for what kakashi has in store for a make-up test sasuke and sakura fed their friend having watched the entire event kakashi dramatically appears before them as kakashi apparently prepares to punish them all sakura stands up to him explains that they gave naruto food because hes a member of their team ultimately finding a group who actually met his tests standards kakashi reveals team 7 have passed his test and accepts them as his students  
after team 7 completes a few miscellaneous d-ranked missions naruto relentlessly asking hiruzen for a higher level mission they are assigned to escort a bridge builder named tazuna back to the land of waves but on their way team 7 is ambushed by the demon brothers two chunin from the hidden mist village in the land of water though it appeared they killed him as they go after team 7 and tazuna the demon brothers learned that kakashi was aware of their presence and faked his death to catch them off guard while seeing his students in action while applauding sasuke for holding off the demon brothers and sakura for guarding tazuna kakashi expresses disappointment in how naruto poorly handled the situation and got himself poisoned but refusing to quit the mission with sasukes taunting getting to him naruto uses a kunai to stabs his hand to bleed out the poison while making a promise to never back down though kakashi decides to have narutos self-inflicted wound dealt with he is amazed by the boys rapid healing while wondering if it is the nine tailss doing elsewhere a man named gato confronts demon brothers boss for his subordinates failure to assassinate tazuna threatening gato with his large sword the figure decides to handle the job personally  
on the way to the land of waves with kakashi threatening to abandon the mission if he does not provide an adequate explanation for lying about the missions difficulty level tazuna reveals desire to build a bridge to save the impoverished land of waves from the wealthy crime lord gato hearing his story team 7 agree to go through with the mission regardless for humanitarian reasons however once on the bridge the group is ambushed by zabuza momochi a rouge ninja from the hidden mist village who works for gato refusing to hand tazuna over kakashi is forced to reveal a strange eye the former confused on how kakashi gained it sasuke and zabuza both recognize the strange eye as the sharingan while team 7 protects tazuna kakashi engages zabuza with the two using clones to distract the other to get them from behind  
kakashi is eventually caught off guard and is captured in a water prison jutsu with kakashi deposed of zabuza creates a water clone to go after team 7 and tazuna though kakashi tells his students to run naruto remembers the promise he made to himself of not backing down and decides to fight to save kakashi and keep tazuna alive with naruto using his transformation skills with sasukes expertise with a fuma shuriken the two youths succeed at forcing zabuza in a position to release kakashi in order to dodge narutos kunai  
once freed from zabuzas water prison jutsu kakashi easily defeats enemy by using his sharingan to replicate many of zabuzas water-based attacks while messing with his head at the last second zabuza is seemingly killed by a young masked hunter ninja from the hidden mist village naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave team 7 so much trouble but kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than naruto yet stronger than himself the hunter-nin leaves with zabuzas body and kakashi then collapses from fatigue as a result of using his sharingan for too long  
brought to tazunas home to recover from his fight with zabuza naruto meeting the bridge builders grandson inari kakashi awakens while realizing that were numerous inconsistencies with zabuzas death and the actions of the masked youth not destroying the body on the spot expecting that they would face zabuza again kakashi decides to take team 7 to the woods to teach them chakra control by having them walk up a tree by infusing chakra into their feet while sakura got it on the first try both naruto and sasuke had to attempt it numerous times with kakashi seeing naruto asking sakura for advice elsewhere revealed to be zabuzas follower the masked youth known as haku tends to zabuzas wounds as the swordsman intends to settle things with kakashi once fully healed within a weeks time  
while naruto and sasuke try to outdo each other in their tree climbing practice sakura accompanies tazuna and astonished by the poverty and fear in the land of waves following dinner sakura asks about inari staring at the torn family photo on the wall before the boy runs off with his mother tsunami chasing after him tazuna then explains that the man torn from the picture named kaiza was once a hero in the land of waves who inari looked up to when gato arrived inari is traumatized when he saw kaiza executed by gatos men to serve as an example of anyone who gets in gatos way moved by the story naruto resumes his training with the intent to show inari that there are still heroes in the world  
taking a nap after training in the woods naruto is waked up by who he thought was a girl eventually learning that the person actually a boy but aware that he is the masked youth haku naruto gets into an exchange of ideals and morals before the two part ways once found by sasuke naruto resumes his tree climbing practice into the evening until he and sasuke finally make it to the top of their respective trees naruto and sasuke return triumphantly to tazunas home with naruto cheerful yet completely drained from the effort inari is disturbed at the sight of naruto thinking about kaiza and as he gets into a heated dispute with naruto who leaves while calling him a coward later that night kakashi tells a despondent inari that naruto understands the boys pain from his own hardships the next morning deciding to let naruto sleep in kakashi sasuke and sakura escort tazuna to work upon arriving at the bridge they find tazunas workers unconscious with zabuza and a masked haku revealing themselves  
at tazunas house two of gatos thugs arrive to kidnap tsunami inari musters his courage in an attempt to stop them but is saved when naruto defeats them before leaving to join the others at the bridge naruto apologizes to inari for calling him a coward and acknowledges his bravery on the bridge as kakashi engages zabuza sasukes newly gained speed gives him an advantage against haku before the masked ninja traps him in his personal jutsu crystal ice mirrors  
having arrived with kakashi preoccupied with zabuza naruto attempts to help sasuke by attacking the crystal ice mirrors from the outside while sasuke attacks from the inside unfortunately oblivious to hakus jutsu naruto enters the crystal ice mirrors as he and sasuke are forced to work together against haku who sees that he must make an exception in his no killing policy  
naruto and sasuke both attempt to destroy the ice mirrors their respective shadow clone and fire ball jutsus having no effect realizing that hakus crystal ice mirrors are actually an ice-style kekkei genkai a bloodline trait kakashi decides to use his sharingan to quickly end his fight with zabuza however as haku told him what kakashis methods during their last fight zabuza has the advantage as he uses his hidden mist jutsu to counter kakashis sharingan and force the ninja to ponder his opponents next move kakashi finally realizes that zabuza will strike at tazuna and sakura and rushes to intercept as zabuza as lands a strike on kakashi from behind with his kubikiribōchō sword  
naruto and sasuke are both injured severely from hakus crystal ice mirrors before the latter reveals his uchiha lineage by revealing his clans own kekkai genkai the sharingan with sasukes sharingan allowing him to track his incredibly fast movements haku deems him a bigger threat than naruto and uses a volley of sendon to force sasuke to take a hit meant for his team mate believing his teammate has died in his arms naruto is enraged as unconsciously taps into chakra of the nine-tails to heal his wounds while punching haku  
after using his new power to punch haku while dispelling his mirrors naruto regains control of his himself when hakus mask breaks away recognizing him as the boy he previously conversed with asking naruto to kill him as he failed zabuza revealing that he inherited his ability from his mother haku reveals that he once lived in the land of water where people with kekkei genkai are forced to conceal their powers out of fear of persecution when hakus father learned of his power he killed hakus mother and forced haku to subconsciously invoke his powers to kill his father and the angry mob some time after haku was founded by zabuza and trained to hone his skills to be of use to the swordsman meanwhile having sensed naruto only released a fraction of the nine tailss chakra kakashi summons a number of dogs to find and restrain zabuza at that time haku manages to convince naruto to kill him before seeing kakashi about to finish zabuza off with his lightning blade  
though he agrees to kill haku naruto instead witnesses haku sacrificing himself to protect zabuza from kakashis lightning blade unfazed by his apprentices sacrifice zabuza continues attacking kakashi while tazuna accompanies sakura to sasukes body eventually kakashi manages to disable zabuzas arms but before the battle can end gato arrives with his men with the intent to kill everyone present with zabuza included meanwhile disappointed in the villagers are attempts to rally their support for the bridge inari sets out alone but finds a crowd waiting for him outside  
now fired by gato zabuza no longer sees a reason to fight kakashi while unfazed at his former employer kicking hakus corpse around though zabuza sees haku as nothing more than a tool he is moved by narutos words as he tearfully acknowledges hakus sacrifice with kakashi telling naruto not to interfere out of respect zabuza is allowed to redeem himself as a ninja with only a kunai in his mouth enduring multiple stabs and beatings zabuza manages to break through gatos men and kills the crime lord before collapsing as gatos forces retreat when villagers arrive soon after team 7 are relieved to discover that sasuke is still alive as the senbon were laced with a sleeping drug honoring zabuzas dying wish to place him by haku kakashi assures his former enemy that he and haku will go to the same place soon after he and team 7 give the two rouge ninjas a burial with zabuzas kubikiribōchō as a grave marker naruto express his distain for the notion that ninjas should strive to become merely tools and declares that he will find his own ninja way as team 7 leave for the hidden leaf tazuna proclaims to the village that the bridge will be called the great naruto bridge to signify the strength that naruto gave inari who in turn gave to the whole town  
after their adventure in the land of waves team 7 has returned to doing odd job missions with narutos rivalry with sasuke is making matters worst to the point that kakashi decides to call it a day and sends his students home after sasuke takes his leave naruto and sakura meet up with konohamaru and his friends udon and moegi as antics ensue with him making sakura mad konohamaru accidentally bumps into two foreign ninja despite advice from his older sister temari kankuro threatens to kill konohamaru after somehow tripping naruto kankuro was about to hurt konohamaru when sasuke pelts the ninja with a stone just as kankuro is about to attack sasuke he is stopped by his younger brother gaara as temari explains that they are ninja from the hidden sand village in the land of wind who have arrived for the chunin exams

following team 7 revealed to have a crush on sakura lee challenges sasuke to a battle feeling neglected in his team-mates shadows narutos attempt to fight lee himself only ended with him being easily knocked out now interested to face an opponent calling himself the strongest genin sasuke accepts his challenge but finds himself powerless against an opponent who use taijutsu lee was about to finish the fight with his shadow of the dancing leaf attack when a large turtle named ningame appears soon after as naruto thinks ningame is his mentors lees actual mentor might guy appears with team 7 a bit taken back by guys tough love and motivative speech to lee upon noticing them guy reveals himself to be a rival of kakashis before taking his leave after giving lee a punishment to perform before leaving lee reveals confesses that only used sasuke to train himself against another after naruto pressures sasuke over this turn of events team 7 reaches the room where the exams are to take place

as everyone takes their seat ibiki explains that the first phase of the exam will be a written test where the team with the most points continues to the next phase ibikis assistants line the sides of the room to observe the genin to make sure they do not cheat with team removed from the room if one member is caught cheating five times with the exception of naruto and sakura sasuke and everyone realize that the real test is to subtly cheat through their unique skills while sakura is able to answer the questions naruto is the opposite as he feels he must place all his faith in the final question which will be given fifteen minutes before the tests end  
forty-five minutes into the written portion of the chūnin exams ibiki announces that it is time for the tenth and final question but he ominously states that while their team would fail the exam if they do not take it failure to answer it correctly would result in the participant being barred from future chunin exams fretting over the turn of events naruto refuses to accept give in to fear with his outburst putting the minds of those remaining at ease seeing no one else leaving ibiki reveals that the first nine were to their skills in intel gathering while the final question was to test their resolve passing ibikis test the proctor amused to find naruto passed his test without answering any question the remaining genin meet their next instructor anko mitarashi the next day at the sight of the second phase of the exam the forest of death

a few minutes after entering the forest of death naruto leaves the team to relieve himself but he is knocked out by a genin from the hidden rain village who assumes his form to infiltrate team 7 luckily seeing through the disguise sasuke drives away the attacking rain genin while he and his team mates go over a password to identify themselves in such a situation naruto is separated from the others by a powerful gust of wind before being swallowed by a giant snake in the meantime sasuke and sakura are disabled by a grass ninja named shiore before they even fight sasuke and sakura have visions of their own deaths upon looking into shiores eyes paralyzing them with fear regaining his composure sasuke flees with sakura as shiore pursues luckily having managed to kill the snake naruto arrives in time to save both of them  
despite narutos timely appearance sasuke offers shiore the scroll in exchange for their lives sasuke then throws the scroll to the shiore but naruto intercepts it naruto punches sasuke during his attempt to convince him into giving the scroll up naruto accusses sasuke of being an impostor as the sasuke he knew would never be so weak and cowardly shiore summons a giant snake and engages naruto who uses the nine tails chakra to fight eventually learning his opponent is the host of the nine tails shiore seals narutos ability to access the monsters power as narutos unconscious body is saved by sakura pinning it to a tree with a kunai in mid air sasuke manages to muster the courage from narutos words to fight meanwhile anko learns of three faceless corpses found near the exams one of them revealed to be shiore and recognizes that jutsu used to remove their faces  
after a protracted battle with the mysterious ninja posing as shiore sasuke traps the ninja and creates a new jutsu on the spot in the heat of battle to incinerate his attack however the ninja is still alive with his face partially melted off to reveal part of the figures true face after extending his neck to inflict sasuke with a mark the ninja introduces himself as orochimaru burning the scroll he possessed orochimaru leaves while promising sasuke that he will look for him anko eventually finds orochimaru her former teacher and unsuccessfully tries to kill him while learning that his target was sasuke and that any interference in the chunin exams to remove the youth from the proceedings will end terribly for the hidden leaf village  
after the ordeal with orochimaru sakura managed to move her team mates under a tree to tend to their wounds through out the night sakura is unaware that her team are being watched by team dosu who placed an explosive tag on a squirrel that sakura wards off without knowledge of it being made a bomb soon after the sound genin makes their presence known as they reveal their intent to kill sasuke while dealing with the numerous traps that sakura prep to defend her team mates luckily having been guided by the squirrel after saving it lee arrives to protect saura with his last breath as the battle ensued lee uses the front lotus on dosu before the impact is cushioned by zaku abumi and lee knocked out  
with her team mates and lee all unconscious sakura is forced to fight on her own before one of the sound genin kin tsuchi grabs the girl by her hair and proceeds to give her a bloody beating this causes sakura to remember her past with her own rival ino yamanaka and remembers why she grew her hair so long she then focuses on being a strong ninja rather than just an attractive one cutting her hair to free herself from kins grasp before attacking zaku moved by sakuras determination ino and the rest of team 10 come to sakuras aid  
team 10 battles team dosu each using their unique techniques to battle however though ino uses her mind-transfer jutsu on kin the sound genin regain the advantage before sasuke suddenly awakens empowered by orochimarus curse mark sasuke is rendered a cruel and sadistic monster as he easily defeats zaku while crippling his arm terrified by sasukes extremely cruel brutality sakura stops him before he can kill and instruct fatality on either of the sound genin deciding they stand no chance dosu leaves a scroll so he and his team can retreat without further harm  
as team 7 team 10 and team guy recover team 8 witnesses gaara mercilessly kill a team of rain genin although gaara prepares to turn his attention to team 8 his siblings persuade him to leave them alone gaaras team beats the previous record for getting to the tower by a gigantic margin and none of them are even remotely injured  
kabuto separated from his team accompanies team 7 to the tower in the center of the forest along the way the group encounters a disorienting genjutsu set by the hidden rain gennin group whose member sasuke had earlier defeated by the time they realize that they are not getting any closer to the center of the forest they are attacked by a number of clones

andy goes on the warpath to prove that officer ed laughlin set up clark on the heroin bust from a week ago andy checks laughlins old arrests and contacts he finds out a non-reformed dealer was asked by laughlin for heroin but declined because he does not trust old ed very much he also meets a punk who offers to lie and save the day and ends up shoving the punks face into a plate of gross-looking barbecue ed once again threatens andy but andys more confident now and ignores ed andy then gets a break when the cops find a guy who was ripped off for the heroin involved in clark being arrested unfortunately the guy is terrified of being killed by his boss and an attempt to get laughlin incriminating himself on tape fails clark jr meanwhile is visited in prison by now-retired clark sr who seems more angry that his son trusts andy more than his drunken self to handle the case than that his son has been framed due to clark srs stupidity clark sr begs andy to help gets useless information and andy tells him hes a drunk just like andy is a broken clark sr asks andy if its his fault his son is in jail and andy pointedly refuses to answer him the light from earlier in the day flickers out when the guy who got ripped off is gunned down on the streets and clark jr asks andy how hes going to beat the case at trial in the b story two young women are raped in public parks theyre both furious at their boyfriends for not comforting them but rita and connie find out the boyfriends were bound and gagged and forced to witness the attacks they also find surprisingly that the rapist—who yelled that he was infecting the girls with hiv—was using a condom during both attacks and that he took off his stocking mask as well the boyfriends stop fronting and id him from photos as an ex-con named will connie tells will they know his sad story how he tried to break into an atm with his car and got 2 years jail time and once he was inside he ended up being raped by just about every bigger older prisoner in the entire place he was left hiv+ carried out the rapes as retaliations and is not sorry about going back to jail and getting more revenge 
andy and connie arrive at a crime scene where ed laughlin tries to act like theyre all colleagues but andy throws him out of the place connie warns andy too much about laughlin getting revenge and andy basically tells her to get lost officer shannon then gestures that he wants to talk to andy and after several false starts says he has information about what happened with clark and laughlin shannon then tells andy lt rodriguez ada haywood and captain fraker how laughlin stole the heroin and said he was using it to even the score with clark fraker isnt moved but caves when the ada demands clarks immediate release laughlin is arrested and dragged out of the stationhouse crying a shocked and relieved clark jr is released after which his father shows up drunk at the 15th telling the uniformed cops he leaked the iab information and his son did nothing wrong clark jr later confronts his dad at home and tells him to stop making decisions for him and a dejected clark sr leaves the episodes crime investigation is of a wealthy gay man who is bankrolling a convict named arturos appeal of his life sentence in exchange for arturo pimping out young latino men to him arturo turns on the guy and has a youth whom he protected in jail go and do a robbery of something that didnt exist arturo is happy about this until andy gives him some bad news andy had planned to honor a deal between them for information that would keep arturo in a prison close to his family but now andys going to call in a favor from a bop friend and have arturo sent to a freezing prison thats 11 hours from the city for the rest of his life a woman who tried to help female gang members leave the life is murdered and rita zeroes in on a vulnerable young woman whose boyfriend may have been involved the cops find out a meek neighbor arranged for the boyfriend to rob the womans place out of anger that a close friend of his was evicted before she moved in and the boyfriend stabbed her to death 
domestic issues begin to weigh heavily on andy and connie with andy being so irritated by their arguments about chores and taking care of the kids that he covertly inquires whether paa john might be willing to let him have his old apartment back john is polite but later makes a pointed reference to a florist recommended by the police association since andy had ridiculously claimed the jobs scrutiny was the reason he might have to stop cohabitating with connie however andy gets a new perspective on a case involving a pompous insurance guy who was set up for robbery after nearly cheating on his wife with a transvestite prostitute and connie decides to put together a romantic meal that sets everything right the other cops investigate the murder of a girl from pakistan her father does not care she was killed and says hes only sorry he didnt do it himself as shed disgraced the family by dating an american a slackerish white guy who is sorry shes dead but equally useless on whodunit the killer turns out to be a random homeless insane guy who murdered a complete stranger because of the demons driving him on 
 
julian pisano the half-helpful half-worthless snitch from season 9 was shot and wounded during what he claims was a carjacking though andy and clark jr dont really buy his story however a random video recorder caught the shooting on tape and leads the cops to a hitman with a bad back who tells them that julians wife and her lover hired him to murder julian julian does not want to believe them but the cops especially andy tell him they have to play things cool or shell get away with attempted murder connie and rita catch a case where a woman was scammed for 100 in the street and the woman gets increasingly annoyed and complains to a high level of the nypd when no restitution is provided connie and rita are equally annoyed with her until the womans neighbor tells them that before she was scammed a hit and run driver killed her 8-year old son both cases are thrown into a new light when clark jr goes to check on his father and finds clark sr dead on the couch with his brains splattered on the wall behind him andy has clark jr retrieve his fathers gun cleaning kit and gets the arriving me to say that clark sr died cleaning his gun a police cover for an officers suicide that allows his family to claim his death benefits clark jr is in complete shock and ritas attempts to talk to him dont work the other cops eerily stage a scene of julian posing as dead and andy goes to meet julians wife posing as a hitman the ploy works and she gets arrested but not before screaming that she gave her lover everything because hes a real man when the complainant in the scam case shows up connie gathers the 100 from the squad members and julian agrees to pose as one of the two scammers to give her some closure julian then breaks into tears while recounting his wifes real betrayal and the woman somehow ends up consoling him at night clark jr goes home and watches a farewell video from his father before breaking into tears of his own

after escaping from another fleet of navy ships the straw hats drop anchor outside a town with a huge tower after they set foot on land an official demands that they pay a harbor tax the straw hats meet a scientist named henzo who asks them if they have seen what he calls the rainbow mist the other citizens of the town dislike henzo because they have to pay high taxes to fund for his research while shopping with nami and chopper sanji has a violent encounter with a tax collector who is wearing an electric battle suit a large unmanned galley appears in the harbor in the same condition that henzo saw it fifty years ago henzo luffy robin and usopp board it further out at sea a rainbow-colored mist appears and the group uses the straw hats ship to enter it  
inside the mist luffy and his group discover a large ship graveyard luffy salvages a chest filled with gold and jewels from one of the shipwrecks but a distant voice tells him to return the treasure and leave the mist usopp believes the voices to be ghosts but they actually originate from a group of children who call themselves the pumpkin pirates in his youth henzo was a member of this group and they are the reason for his research he spent his life in search of a means to rescue them from the rainbow mist only a short time earlier from their point of view but fifty years earlier from henzos perspective a group of pirates led by a captain whetton attacked the childrens town when whetton came after the children they tried to escape by stealing the pirates ship during the fight whetton smashed the ships helm and henzo jumped overboard taking whetton with him while the other children sailed into the mist  
after entering the rainbow mist the children followed the orders of ian the only pirate left on the ship he mistreated them and they eventually locked him up in the brig of the wreck of a navy ship luffy and his group try to escape the mist but they soon realize that they need help the straw hats persuade one of the children to lead them to the pumpkin pirates hiding place so they can ask them for a way out usopp prepares a steaming meal which causes most of the children to like the straw hats however their leader lapanui remains suspicious and unwilling to help henzos snail-o-phone rings and the son of whetton wants henzo to investigate the mist not knowing that the professor is already inside the mist when lapanui hears whettons name he loses what little he trust has for henzo  
lapanui accuses henzo of being whettons lapdog and says that in the past henzo would have never allowed that to happen usopp tells lapanui that henzo had endured the same insults from the townspeople yet still tried to rescue the children then for no apparent reason luffy slingshots himself and lapanui to another part of the mist at the harbor nami ties a long lifeline prepared by henzo to a boat and enters the rainbow mist once inside ian who convinced one of the children to release him steals the boat and escapes he reaches whetton and describes to him the mists treasures whetton orders his men to invade the mist the towns large tower falls into the water creating a bridge from the island into the mist and whetton and his men cross it to attack  
luffy and lapanui are outside the mist and use the newly created bridge to re-enter it there luffy fights whetton and as it becomes clear that he cannot defeat luffy face-to-face whetton detonates the tower trapping everyone else inside and whettons abandoned men join forces with luffys group an exit appears in the distance and they row toward it but it closes too fast for them to reach it hoping to generate enough wind to blow the straw hats ship clear of the mist lapanui stays behind to destroy the navy ships armory the other children follow him promising to meet henzo again the explosion they cause successfully blows the straw hats ship outside the mist there a group of navy ships led by an aged lapanui arrives and confiscates the rainbow mists treasures from whetton and takes him and his men into custody  


at the request of his father ryoma echizen moves to japan after having success at tennis in the united states having won four consecutive american junior openings on his way to a japanese tennis tournament he saves sakuno ryuzaki from some thugs due to this he misses the tournament however he finds an opponent in the form of one of the thugs he met on the subway he then puts his opponent sasabe in his place during the match where he reveals his exceptional tennis capabilities  
upon his arrival in seishun academy seigaku for short ryoma teaches a lesson to two juniors who are picking on the freshmen takeshi momoshiro one of the teams regulars puts a stop to it and decides to play ryoma in a tennis match noticing that momoshiro has a bad ankle ryoma decides not to play with his dominant hand also sakunos energetic friend tomoka is introduced to ryoma and instantly proclaims herself to be his number one fan  
the seigaku regulars are introduced while a journalist mamoru inoue and a photographer saori shiba visit seigaku in order to report on the teams upcoming ranking matches meanwhile ryoma defeats a second year non-regular arai using an old broken tennis racket when the latter hides all three of ryomas rackets seeing his skill the captain of the tennis team kunimitsu tezuka enters ryomas name on the roster for the intraschool ranking matches despite the fact that he is a freshman  
the seigaku ranking matches has begun and ryoma and the seigaku regulars continue to win their matches early on in the tournament ryoma then gets pitted against regular kaoru kaido in the third round where the latter reveals his special move the snake shot this throws ryoma off guard so he decides to switch to his dominant hand  
kaido attempts to use his snake shot to wear off ryomas stamina and though ryoma initially shows signs of sweating and fatigue he surprises both kaido and the spectators when his speed and power does not decrease near the end it is revealed that ryoma had been implementing a plan he had been specifically hitting shots that kaido had to bend his knees in order to return thus kaido would lose stamina far faster than ryoma his plan works earning him the win  
inoue plays a match with nanjiro echizen the former samurai nanjiro a legendary tennis professional to get answers about why he retired though nanjiro appears to not be taking it seriously his skills show otherwise and he easily beats inoue with both his eyes closed however inoue finds out that nanjiro is now focusing on developing the skills of his son ryoma meanwhile sakuno looks for ryoma to learn more about him and tennis  
in ryomas next ranking match he plays against inui sadaharu who uses data tennis to counter ryomas play style using the data he gathered from ryomas previous match inui is able to dominate the match by accurately predicting and countering ryomas moves though irritated ryoma refuses to give up and reveals that he is glad to have transferred into seigaku because he can now play against different types of players like inui  
in order to counter inuis data ryoma uses a new technique he had practiced when playing against his father the one-footed split step this requires him to continuously hop in place so he can react faster to the ball as well as be able to move to another part of the court more quickly using this technique ryoma gains enough agility and speed to return inuis calculated shots this along with the twist serve surpasses inuis data and turns the game into ryomas favor  
inui continues to be unable to return ryomas twist serve resulting in his eventual loss ryoma then wins his next games and finally becomes a regular meanwhile inui plays against his next opponent kaido who also surpasses inuis data and takes a spot in the regulars as well with eight spots taken inui loses his place as a regular however seigakus coach sumire ryuzaki asks him to help in the regulars training instead during training he introduces his special and dreaded vegetable juice which most of the regulars fall victim to

realizing that the only remaining singles slot left is singles 3 ryoma and momoshiro compete for it when they both want to play singles in the upcoming match against gyokurin middle school however when they decide to settle it with a match they end up playing doubles against locals instead though they defeat their first few challengers they are utterly defeated by two cocky gyokurin players due to their lack of teamwork it is then that the two decide to play doubles in the upcoming match  
momoshiro and ryoma volunteer to play in doubles 2 and develop a tactic to improve their playing coordination however despite their practice they continue to clash with each other due to their natural dominant tendencies as singles players in addition their rivals use a strategy which takes advantage of momoshiro and ryomas lack of coordination turning the game into their favor  
with their new strategy gyokurin continues to dominate irritated ryoma and momoshiro realize that they are truly not suited to be doubles players and agree to split the court in half now they each only have to defend one half of the court and is able to utilize their individual skills though strange it is an effective strategy that wins them the game however due to their shameful performance they still receive punishment from their coach

determined to overcome fujis skills fudomines tetsu ishida tries a desperate measure to seal fujis tsubame gaeshi by using a hit of considerable strength called hadokyu when he aims it directly toward fuji kawamura decides to get in its way when he realizes that fuji would not be able to return it hoverer though he succeeds in returning it he hurts his wrist in the process forcing seigaku to forfeit the match  
thanks to eiji kikumarus acrobatics and shuichiro oishis ability to adapt to his partners style seigakus golden pair wins their doubles match easily next is the game between kaido and kamio akira where kaorus snake shot turns out to be ineffective against the speed ace from fudomine in a moment of desperation kaido inadvertently performs a near impossible shot around the nets pole which is then dubbed the boomerang snake  
kaido desperately tries to recreate the boomerang snake but he eventually stops his attempts when he decides to just play his style of tennis with neither side yielding kamios and kaidos game becomes an endurance match however in the end kaidos willpower and persistence outlasts kamios stamina also momoshiro learns the identity of the girl he has been recently running into who turns out to be fudomines player-coach and kippei tachibanas younger sister an tachibana  
tezuka found out nanjiro is ryomas father nanjiro echizen finds a letter from ryuzaki and remembers the days when he trained under her as a seigaku regular meanwhile ryomas opponent shinji ibu shows his skills when he is able to return ryomas twist serve as well as his revealing his own serve the kick serve which is similar to the twist serve ryoma then switches to his left hand and the game heats up between the two players serves  
ryoma struggles to resist ibus spot a technique where ibu forces ryoma to hit certain shots that temporarily paralyzes his arm however when ryoma tries to spin his body instead of moving his arm the racket gets loose from his grip and it bounces back hitting his eye with his eyelid bleeding it seems impossible for him to continue but he insists on continuing the match  
impressed with his determination tezuka gives ryoma ten minutes to finish the game after which he will forfeit the match in the end ryoma manages to overcome ibus spot and wins the match right before his alloted time had ended with ryomas win seigaku wins the tournament and after tending to his wounds the seigaku regulars celebrate in kawamuras sushi restaurant  
due to their recent victories spies from other schools begin to observe seigakus training when they catch two of the spies spying on them even after school hours momoshiro and ryoma teach the two of them a lesson in a doubles match when the two spies are only able to score one point against them they decide to practice their tennis instead of spying on others  
while kaido starts his daily training momoshiro and kamio akira end up playing a doubles match against two hyotei regulars atobe keigo and munehiro kabaji when the latter two pick on an tachibana meanwhile ryoma and shinji ibu battle over grip tape by creating a contest in which they catch a pickpocket kaido is then unwittingly dragged into the mess when he is suspected of being the thief

ryoma is asked by coach ryuzaki to go to the racket-stringer with sakuno whom he constantly ignores though unknowingly curious what ryoma is up to nanjiro decides to follow him and after seeing the two together momoshiro and the freshman trio spy on the two believing that that they are on a date however ryoma continues to ignore her and even end up hurting her feelings when she asks about him in the end ryoma tries to make up for it by teaching her some tennis  
feeling that ryomas tennis is a simple copy of his fathers tezuka asks coach ryuzaki for permission to play an unofficial match against ryoma before his match tezuka and oishi go to a clinic to check whether or not tezukas arm has healed though it is healed the doctor warns him not to play long matches and to not use his drop shot after finding out he is fine he meets up with ryoma suspicious of the twos meeting oishi decides to follow the pair to see what is really going on

the next tournament starts and the seigaku team is informed of their positions momoshiro and kaido are unexpectedly paired up to play doubles 2 against st rudolphs atsushi kisarazu and shinya yanagisawa even though the two have been rivals since they were freshmen ironically however though they argue with each other they appear to be a compatible team who can play on each others strengths and weaknesses  
though momoshiro and kaido are a compatible team they constantly butt heads in the court resulting in them struggling as the opponents also know their strengths and weaknesses as well however the last-ditch appearance of kaidos latest technique the boomerang snake throws mizukis carefully laid plans in disarray since he believed that kaido was unable to perform the technique at will this also motivates momoshiro to evolve as well  
momoshiro knocks out the st rudolph player yanagisawa when his dunk smash accidentally hits the player thus seigaku wins doubles 2 by default eiji and oishi the famed golden pair takes to the courts against st rudolphs ichirou kaneda and its captain yoshirou akazawa in the match mizukis information helps the st rudolph pair tire out eiji which is when oishi reveals his famed technique the moon volley which can land directly on the baseline

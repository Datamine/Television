in 2035 years before kiera was born the world has fallen into social chaos major corporations prop up remaining government structures to maintain control the corporations institute a form of debtors prisons in which people who cannot afford to pay their debts to the corporations are officially stripped of their citizenships and implanted with mind-control chips permanently making them brain-dead zombies who serve as worker-drones in corporate factories julian/theseuss followers stage coordinated attacks on such factories all across north america while theseus himself leads an attack on the factory at new pemberton before blowing up the facility julian orders his men to shut off the mind-control chips in the thousands of factory workers killing all of them his rationale is that the corporations already functionally killed them and their deaths will strike a blow against the corporations which will ultimately save millions

alejandro and carmen offer different opinions about his new relationship as alejandro who wants to keep his sexual identity a secret from the public considers dumpping his boyfriend a neat freak after he lets him stay with him leading carmen to tell his lover the truth that he wants to end it eventually the guy destroys everything in response but not before seeking revenge by giving a photo of the two together to a tabloid paper marisol gets closer to the truth by testing the theory to see if remi knew anything about flora being pregnant prompting ida to become suspicious of remi and warning marisol about michael who happens to be the lawyer of both remi and the supposed killer at the same time taylor becomes jealous of michael spending time seeing olivia at the hospital so marisol suggest to taylor that she should be supportive by going with michael who then suggests that she should keep a eye on marisols activities after taylor tells him that she was eavesdropping on his phone conversation in his office room rosie cleans up a serious mess for peri who accidentally causes a hit-and-run on a jogger who survived the incident and saw the driver this causes rosie to distrust peri and causes rosie to ask spence if they want to be together while peri convinces her studio boss to help her bring rosies son to america philippe and genevieve grow closer but zoila does not believe that he is changed his philandering ways so she uses a scheme to show proof along with a distrusting remi learning the truth about his father after he knocks him for insulting valentina then whispering something in his ear indicating that remi knows something about philippe and flora but the plan backfires as genevieve tells zoila that she wants to go ahead with the wedding plans 
carmen is tempted by a reporter to out alejandro and is willing to pay if she goes through with it but believes that alejandro should do it himself however the matters are made worse when sam returns to resume his relationship with carmen and is caught in the middle after he hugs alejandro while they are in boxers which is caught on camera and leaked to the internet prompting alejandro to come up with a solution while leaving sam embarrassed rosie is stunned by spences return and his decision to ask rosie to marry him but rosie is even more stunned by peris announcement that she plans to bring rosies son miguel to america putting rosie in a awkward position between the troubled couple and where her loyalty lies remi who has forgiven philippe after admitting that he was trying to protect him from being accused as the father of floras unborn child is accepted to medical school and will spend a year in africa but he wants valentina to come with him and zoila is making sure that does not happen meanwhile genevieve asks evelyn to hold a wedding reception at the powells whose own marriage could be headed for a costly divorce after evelyn tells adrian that she wants to end theirs because of adrians admission that he does love her but will not be intimate with her marisol learns more of philippes involvement with flora after zoila tells her about remi hitting his father leading philippe to learn from michael about marisol and when her identity is discovered philippe tells michael that he will take care of the situation making michael nervous and decides to warn marisol anyway but taylor who now knows the truth wants her to stay unfortunately philippe hired a hitman to kill marisol but instead shoots the pregnant taylor by mistake 
as taylor learns that she has lost the baby she tells michael its time to tell marisol about flora marisol finally comes clean to the other maids about herself as well as her quest to clear her son and they all band together to help her expose floras real killer carmens relationship with sam and her friendship with odessa is about to get an unwelcome reaction as alejandro asks carmen to marry him in order to keep his sexual orientation a secret by helping her finally get a record deal as part of the pact meanwhile rosie and spences relationship is discovered by peri after she overhears the conversation on the phone from miguel remis disappearance has genevieve worried and valentina disappointed as genevieves engagement party nears with philippe attempting to convince genevieve to elope after the party by taking her out of the country while valentina becomes furious about zoila lying to her about the letter she had wrote about remi the news of taylor and michael at the hospital prompts adrian and evelyn to postpone their divorce and suspect that something behind it isnt right when philippe asks for their private jet at the engagement party the ladies finally corner the real killer as marisol confronts philippe in the same room where flora was killed but after evelyn discovers her and has her escorted out its adrian who kills philippe by poisoning his drink upon learning that philippe was the person who showed up the night uninvited and stabbed flora to death of which he would later confess to michael as marisol found out at the hospital the ladies unaware of philippes demise adrian and evelyn tell the police that he committed suicide tell the police that he confessed out loud before he died helping marisol and clearing eddie of floras murder however this happy ending is stunted when ice us immigration and customs enforcement officers arrive to arrest rosie during a celebration of eddies release as peri who was the one who called the ice looks on in the background

whilst en route to finding both anne and alexis tom and the boys are robbed of both supplies and horses by a local family enraged by this the masons track them down to a local farm where they regain control of their supplies however a struggle ensues between hal and one of the brothers and matt shoots him and critically wounds him after the brother dies tom hal ben and matt leave and continue their journey in finding anne and alexis but they soon find that skitters and mechs are on their way to the farm tom decides to go back where he finds the house empty and is confronted by the skitters and the mechs meanwhile cochise brings an injured president hathaway back to charleston for medical attention with cochise back marina uses this opportunity to question him about the volm weapon that is being built for the upcoming attack against the espheni cochise explains that the weapon will be used against the soon to be activated espheni planetary defense grid that when activated will envelope the earth and wipe out all human life on the earth within 3 months by irradiating the planets surface he later explains that the weapon will inject a massive amount of energy into the grid in the hope it will overload and destroy it and explains that there is a risk that if it is unsuccessful the irradiation process will be accelerated and that all human life on the surface could be lost president hathaway is murdered in his hospital bed by the real mole who is revealed to be lourdes acting under espheni mind-control via eye worms under her skin peralta and weaver come to the conclusion that hal wasnt the mole and suspect someone at charleston was involved with the murder 
tom awakens next to his wife rebecca jennifer ferrin to discover he has been living an ordinary but perfect life as a college professor and as a father to his three sons in a world that has not been invaded by the espheni things were going well for him until he starts to receive messages from anne glass that imply he is having an affair behind his wifes back but with no memory of the 2nd mass anne or the alien invasion he becomes increasingly concerned that hes been living somebody elses life as a result his world starts to fall apart around him when four locations are made exceedingly clear to him he begins to suspect something is not quite right and awakens from the dream to find out that karen was trying to manipulate him into revealing the location where the volm weapon will be used when seemingly he is rescued and shoots karen dead he awakens later in charleston and heads to the briefing room to find four maps of locations seen in his dream and realizes he is still being manipulated by karen breaking free from the dream he awakens in the real world to discover that karen has had anne and alexis killed after breaking down in tears and initially trying to attack karen he is later shown the activation of the espheni planetary defense grid he then escapes by jumping from the ledge using a skitter to break his fall after traveling to his old house he dreams of his wife and is told to move forward with his life and that there was nothing left for him there meanwhile back in charleston suspicions are cast over peralta when an explosion destroys the only radio that can contact president hathaways forces almost killing weaver after initially being refused permission to join the front line troops in the upcoming operation maggie after saving weavers life has her request accepted meanwhile hal matt and ben return to charleston without tom but believe their father will return home 
tom finally returns to charleston where he relays the news of anne and alexis deaths as well as the fact that the boston tower is vulnerable to an assault and should be the target of their attack however his ulterior motive is to get revenge on karen unfortunately the volm complex is suddenly destroyed in a massive explosion with cochise being the only survivor weaver and peralta suspect it is the work of the mole meanwhile a heavily wounded cochise tells tom that he will eventually regenerate from his wounds lourdes overhears this conversation and decides to try and assassinate cochise she plants another bomb that severely damages the charleston mall causing numerous cave ins and blocking off all of the exits hal and maggie are trapped in the armory and nearly suffocate until they are rescued by ben and matt hal realizing that maggie is angry at him for leaving her behind to search for anne and alexis promises to allow her to accompany him when they hunt down karen meanwhile tom realizes lourdes is the mole when she accidentally reveals her knowledge of annes death in boston she is immediately restrained before she can assassinate cochise tom then takes lourdess weapon and uses it to blast a hole open at one of the exits opening up an escape route afterwards tom talks with a fully healed cochise tom assures him that even with the complex destroyed and all of cochises comrades dead the weapon itself should still be intact they just need to dig it out and figure out how to operate it 
 
after having finally dug the volm weapon out of the rubble it was buried under the 2nd mass stages its attack while weaver leads a diversionary attack on the chicago tower tom assaults the boston tower with the volm weapon and successfully manages to destroy it shutting down the espheni defense grid with the defense grid down the promised volm reinforcements finally arrive in a gigantic city-sized ship that destroys the remains of boston when it lands it is then revealed that the volm reinforcements are being led by cochises father unfortunately while the 2nd mass is celebrating their victory tom and weaver discover that the volm intend to keep the humans out of the war by shipping them off to relative safety in brazil angry at being deprived of their chance to fight for their planet tom and weaver object tom is taken into custody and weaver is forced to surrender the 2nd mass to the volm however cochises father is intrigued by the humans eagerness to fight and tom and cochise manage to convince him to let the 2nd mass go the volm stand down and allow the humans to fight the espheni also despite the great dangers they still face the 2nd mass is beginning the long trek back to charleston when an espheni ships lands nearby karen then reveals herself offering a truce as the espheni are weakened and telling tom that the volm cannot be trusted tom responds by vengefully shooting karen fatally wounding her hal tends to a dying karen whom maggie finishes off with her gun 
tom then discovers that anne and alexis are in fact still alive- karen had brought them to him as a gesture of good faith for her truce however as tom reunites with anne he is shocked to see that alexis has grown to the equivalent of a six year old in just two months when they return to the regiments camp alexis comes across lourdes and through some unknown means extracts and destroys the eye worms infecting her with her bare hands to the amazement of tom and dr kadar

as april and matthew’s wedding day draws near the doctors at grey sloan memorial hospital prepare for the big day while dealing with their own issues derek is working with a federal initiative that wants to use his name to support their work but he refuses their offer because he is supposed to be cutting back so that meredith can take more time for her research alex starts to get along with his dad but it comes to a halting stop when his dad starts talking poorly of his mother meredith and cristina argue while getting fitted for their bridesmaid dresses but when they show up to aprils wedding they start to mend their differences by accepting that they are in different places bailey tells ben that its essentially his fault for her ocd troubles because her symptoms only worsened when he quit surgery jimmy requires emergency heart surgery and shane rushes him into the or however webber has to take over when shane begins to relive brooks death during april and matthews wedding derek gets a call from the president of the united states and jackson stands up and confesses his love for april 
after a short prologue in which april and jackson drive off together - april still hesitant over her actions - and arizona tries to end her marriage with callie the episode skips to three weeks later meredith is upset with derek for agreeing to the presidents offer which means going back on his promise to her to take a back seat to her research callie and arizona buy a new house that’ll be theirs together with arizona wanting to give their relationship one last new start chief hunt begins to ride ross aggressively in the er not just after the botched surgery with jimmy but according to an accusative webber because he has learned that ross had been sleeping with cristina alexs emotional plea to jo turns out to in his mind have been a marriage proposal jo turns him down claiming theyre not ready but continues to stand by him when jimmy passes away bailey and ben start talking and working through his arrival she tells him that she’s worried that he’ll be at home waiting on her just like tucker used to do and he resumes his internship at grey sloan stephanie is having a hard time accepting that jackson broke up with her for april and with leahs encouragement someone anonymously files an hr complaint on behalf of the interns concerning sexual harassment from their attendings in response the hr department implements a strict non-fraternization policy on the spot which could prove problematic for april and jackson who are revealed to have eloped three weeks ago 
with the new non-fraternizing policy in place at grey sloan memorial hospital the doctors have to face a new way of life alex jo jackson and april are all trying to hide the fact that they are together however jackson and april reveal in a meeting which was called to discuss alex and jo’s relationship that they are actually married owen and emma go from discussing children and living together to calling it off after owen sleeps with cristina once more derek’s interview with the president of the united states was cancelled much to his dismay however he later gets a call saying that they want him to run the advisory board for the whole project 
alex has been suspended from surgery for three days as a consequence for his actions during the meeting called to discuss his relationship with jo stephanie accidentally knocks over arizona and jackson with gurneys and while filing an accident report she lets jackson know that there’s no need for him to apologize to her because she’s over him derek has to tell callie that they can’t continue with their research because of the guidelines in his contract with his colleagues at the white house as if thats not enough callie learns the hr complaint was filed by leah against her as leah felt that she was cheated out of a learning opportunity and needed to stand up for herself and others this is the final straw for callie who has another “this-isn’t-working” talk with arizona 
while some doctors at grey sloan memorial hospital are celebrating dr webbers birthday with an awesome surgery others aren’t so happy bailey leah meredith and richard all pitch in on a case that is very rare a patient absorbed his twin while still in the womb cristina while working on her heart trial with ross is working endlessly to set owen up with women she even created him an online dating profile callie and derek butt heads and enter a short-term legal battle concerning their sensors and their research ultimately callie convinces derek that he needs to tell the white house that either the policy of sole ownership of the sensors goes or he goes the white house concedes jacksons mother catherine comes back to town to correct the mistake that she feels was made by april and jackson jackson always feeling bound by his overbearing mother fights against her accusations against april this leads april and jackson to the revelation that they need to work some things out especially the topic of how they will raise their kids 
cristina comes to experience two very different universes—on a quest to answer the question do you know who you are—after she does very difficult heart repair work on her patient who is on a ventilator and paralyzed from the neck down in the first universe the patient decides that he wants to be taken off the ventilator which sends cristina into owen’s arms when she realizes that they are throwing away their love for each other time is quickly passing as the two get married move in together get a dog have a baby await the birth of their second child and see ross win the harper avery award for cristinas trial that she quit on to take care of her family the second universe begins when cristina comes back to reality and her patient says he doesn’t want to be taken off the ventilator this once again sends cristina into owens arms but this time shes happy however the stipulation that they will never have kids still remains which owen initially accepts they continue to have their on-again off-again relationship which drives owen to drinking more than he should putting himself and his patients in grave danger cristina tells him its over for good and she goes on to win the harper avery award for four straight years once again cristina comes back to reality this time her patient decides to be taken off the ventilator however she’s able to save jackson from injuring his hand and her hesitancy to approach owen allows meredith to approach her about a patient which allows owen to get on the elevator before she can greet him 
a virus breaks out at grey sloan memorial hospital because of the close encounters of doctors and patients the virus spreads like wild fire it first knocks out jackson then leah and finally derek its an inopportune time for derek to get sick because its the day of his presentation on brain mapping to fill in for him meredith steps up and delivers her own twist on his speech callie teaches jo about the joys of ortho and how it presents the opportunity to take out all frustration on the patient while helping them plus it pays cristina and owen team up to work on a pair of sisters who have cardiomyopathy caused by an unknown source and even though they caught the issue in time the sisters brother starts showing similar symptoms because cristina is busy on this case shane has to step up and take care of the babies in cristinas trial aka her baby alex receives an offer from a doctor who runs his own private practice alex seriously considers and starts to discuss it with jo april and bailey operate on a child who is very susceptible to infection due to his condition that is no longer treatable with the enzyme treatments he was previously receiving

then chef ramsay then asked the women if they had chosen one member to go to the men as a replacement but when janel told him that they all wanted to go resulting in drawing names instead chef ramsay got angry as only deliberation amongst contestants should decide who to go not a lottery 
 
continuing from the previous episode chef ramsay ordered the women to discuss amongst themselves on who should move to the mens team during the deliberation most of the women who were shocked that zach hadnt been eliminated and did not want to work with him recanted on their previous desires to be the one to join the men ultimately the women decided that nedra would make the move

japan 
aoi yukimura is invited by two of her classmates to have tea after the first day of high school however aoi frantically rejects their invitation due to her difficulty in interacting with her peers preferring instead to further her hobbies aois childhood friend hinata kuraue then approaches and invites her to climb mountains like they did in the past much to her reluctance since she had developed a fear of heights while remembering that hanging out with hinata only brought her misfortune aoi is reluctantly dragged to hinatas home after school to plan a mountaineering expedition  
aoi recalls neglecting peer socializing in favor of indoor hobbies ever since an accident in a jungle gym over at hinatas home aoi meets hinatas father before she is introduced to all of their familys climbing gear as hinata starts to make plans her father refuses to let them climb before they learn the basics of mountaineering and hence shows them how to set up a tent as the girls watch the sunset from the tent hinata recalls the time they went up a mountain to watch the sunrise with her father tearfully recalling the memory aoi agrees to climb with hinata providing the mountain isnt too high  
the next day at school aoi suggests they climb the nearby mt tenran while preparing that night aoi packs a bag filled with equipment and makes sandwiches in an attempt to show off her feminine prowess to hinata the next day aoi gets scared when hinata shows up in her school uniform instead of being outfitted in climbing gear but soon discovers all they have to do is simply walk up the visitors path when they reach the top the girls marvel at the view and have tea while sharing the sandwiches aoi made hinata then begins planning their next climb much to aois surprise  
hinata suggests they have a cooking competition using climbers equipment after enjoying aois previous sandwiches aoi later finds herself at the supermarket happily shopping for ingredients and eventually prepares paella which hinata praises this causes aoi to wonder if hinata is genuinely nice or if she herself is just over-thinking things hinata then presents her own dish which aoi likes however her father reveals that hinata cant actually cook and cheated using freeze dried food afterwards the three of them have dinner and aoi realizes that hinata really cares for those around her  
aoi and hinata stop off at a mountaineering store while browsing through the assortment of items aoi comes across a girl named kaede saito struggling to choose a schlafsäcke kaede explains that she is a backpacker and asks for aois advice on a selection aoi advises kaede to get the more expensive one to not have any regrets later on this makes kaede happy and they exchange emails before kaede makes her purchase and leaves aoi later laments her trouble with making friends but hinata teases that she already knew some time later kaede sends aoi a picture with the schlafsäcke as thanks for her help  
hinata goads aoi into deciding their next mountaineering trip and the latter gets disappointed in herself for always falling for hinatas aoi decides to ask kaede for advice on a mountain selection and gives her a call kaede runs through a list of mountains for aoi including mount tanigawa which she declines due to her fear of heights aoi eventually settles on mount takao since there are special shrines along it where a person can make wishes afterwards aoi wonders what she should dedicate her life to and tells hinata about mount takao the next day at school which the latter agrees upon  
in preparation for their climb up mount takao the girls read a guide containing information about the types of gear they should carry since aoi lacks a backpack they visit the mountaineering store to purchase one with aoi unable to decide hinata asks the store clerk for help and he explains the different types of packs hinata later tells aoi that she doesnt have to be shy to ask for help and even fronts her the difference to purchase a yellow daypack while the girls head home hinata gives aoi the same advice the latter had given to kaede in choosing a schlafsäcke and teases that aoi has to pay her back with interest  
the girls arrive at the takaosanguchi station for their climb up mount takao and hinata notes that aoi is more excited than usual because of all the wishing spots she hopes to visit along the climb as they begin their ascent aois enthusiasm soon gets the better of her and she hurriedly moves forward without pacing herself and soon tires out the girls stop at a rest spot and refresh themselves while looking at the tokyo skytree in the distance before they leave aoi purchases a souvenir for hinata as thanks for her treat but soon finds herself too embarrassed to give it to her as time passes and they visit more and more wishing spots

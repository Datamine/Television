niles gourmet club will soon be awarding the annual golden apron award and the final leg of the contest requires the competitors to host a dinner party at their home since niles is deeply ashamed to admit to the apartment he currently has frasier offers to let him use his place this seems ideal especially when martin mentions that there is a meteor shower predicted on the evening in question and frasiers balcony would be useful as an observation deck however niles discovers a crack in one of the windows with tape over it and promptly says the party will have to be somewhere else he realizes that maris has a beach house that would present a perfect setting and she herself is in antwerp so need never know frasier is offended at the rejection of his own apartment but niles says he can still attend the party on first inspection of the house everything seems fine until they follow the trail of a horrendous smell and discover a dead seal lying on the beach outside desperate that this evening should go well niles and frasier must then hurry to dispose of the creature before the party starts 
roz is in a difficult financial situation struggling to pay for her rent and baby clothes kacls ratings are suffering as a result of the new format but the management still will not change it frasier does not expect this to last and offers to lend roz 1500 to help her along in the meantime he is surprised afterwards to see that she seems to be spending rather extravagantly spa treatment expensive lunches perfume he wonders if he should talk to her about this but martin and niles firmly advise him not to get involved especially since he specifically said to roz that the money was hers to use as she pleased niles is also suffering from reduced spending power and when he discovers that martin has not used a spa gift certificate that niles gave him as a birthday present he begs his father to use it now for the two of them martin is eventually persuaded to use the certificate but the experience is not as relaxing as it should be for either of them fortunately it is not long before kacl re-considers and gives frasier and his colleagues their jobs back although frasier is still troubled 
christmas is approaching and while out shopping with roz and looking for a menorah for his son frasier makes a covert attempt to purchase a sweater for roz just before she realises another woman steps in and rescues frasier by pretending that she is buying it she recognises him from the radio and when he offers his thanks and asks if he can return the kindness she suggests a date with her daughter faye frasier accepts and is pleasantly surprised when he meets her although she is embarrassed at being fixed up by her mother things go well for a while between them and faye visits frasiers apartment with helen one day on their way to catch a plane to florida it is at this point that frasier discovers that faye was under the impression that he was jewish and although this is not a problem for her she is worried what her mother will think he agrees to hide the christmas decorations and play along also getting niles and martin on side the deception proves tricky to sustain as eddie appears dressed in a santa claus costume someone calls round trying to deliver a christmas tree and daphne is busy organising a holiday revue downstairs from which niles appears dressed as jesus 
frasier has always believed that people are fundamentally decent and good but he now finds his beliefs and patience tested when he attempts a series of acts of kindness and they all turn out badly firstly he finds and returns a lost wallet in café nervosa and the owner accuses him of stealing money from it secondly he helps a woman load a dog into her car at the airport and she drives away without thanking him thirdly he stops to help a man with a flat tire and the man calls in to kacl threatening to sue him for damage to his car later driving home in the rain he comes across a stranded woman and considers whether or not to give her a ride despite the events of the day he decides to help her only to discover that she is a prostitute and also a transvestite and that the police are watching everything he is arrested and held at martins old precinct where martin and niles must bail him out upon returning home frasier has to explain what happened to frederick since the incident gained media attention when frederick asks so are you saying you shouldnt help people we return to frasier in the car contemplating whether or not to give the woman a ride he decides to help her the dialogue reveals that the preceding events had simply been a bad daydream he discovers that the woman highly appreciative of his good deed is not a prostitute but actually a fellow resident of his building

the wind and water clans of feng shui compete surrounding a shrine initially creating a pentagram barrier around the land circa 1602 after 275 years this magic begins to reactivate and cause disasters in the tokyo prefecture after each of these incidents a man named reisui claiming to be a water feng shui master appears to provide advice to the victims however as soon as the man leaves a mysterious entrepreneur named saeke turns up to offer his services such as warding stones inscribed with the power of feng shui when the akabeko catches fire from one of its stoves tae and tsubame are to lodge at the kamiya dojo saeke takes a visit there only to be pardoned by tae the group is soon attacked by feng shui fledglings in which the wind feng shui master named jinpu arrives to save them  
jinpu explains to the group regarding the history between the two clans of feng shui a map is shown that while the wind clan had set up an eigou formation that would protect the town the water clan will set up one that would destroy it the water clan will construct railroad tracks to the five locations of the warding stones disguised as their eigou formation reisui later attacks the dojo but later retreats after jinpu retaliates

kaoru has recovered from the spring water given by kenshin and jinpu the two must leave for nikko to find the jade crest hidden in the area before the ryu myaku gets there first sanosuke and tsunan find a book that gave many useful clues but in a difficult language they find the author to explain its contexts clues and hints were being pieced together and the plans of the water clan started to become clearer kenshin and jinpu arrive at nikko only to find out that reisui has the jade crest reisui traps the two in a feng shui illusion but they manage to overcome it sanosuke finds kenshin and jinpu and explains that the ryu myaku has changed their direction toward senjogahara  
kenshin sanosuke and jinpu go to senjogahara encountering the water clan jinpu attacks reisui but the former has proven to be weaker than that of the latter meanwhile the author arrives and tells tsunan to put the dragon statue in the center of the shrine hoping it will stop the ryu myaku jinpu is able to halt and defeat the water clan after reisui sacrifices himself saeke reveals that it was he that possesses the jade crest yet he is shortly defeated thereafter and the jade crest was taken from him by jinpu it is then that jinpu who directs the ryu myaku toward the shrine of which colliding with the dragon statue weakens and stops its feng shui the police department slowly rebuild their stations and kenshin bids jinpu a final farewell

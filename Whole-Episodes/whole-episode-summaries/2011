ichigo tries to fend off ulquiorras attacks with mixed results however he declares that he will never give up even if the arrancar is stronger than he is ulquiorra responds by transforming into a second release resurrección segunda etapa that he claims aizen himself has not seen ichigo attempts to defend himself and get in an attack but ulquiorra is too fast and powerful for him eventually when orihime and ishida reach the surface they discover that ichigo has already been defeated and captured by ulquiorra ulquiorra then tells orihime to watch how he will extinguish her last hope by killing ichigo with that he punches a hole through ichigos chest by firing his cero oscuras

the head captain asks the remaining soul reapers if nozomi is the one he heard about in the report rukia replies that she is and that her name is nozomi kujo yamamoto responds by stating that her name is unimportant as she is a mod soul this upsets nozomi and angers kon he also states that they dont need help from a mod soul suddenly yamamoto senses a strong spiritual pressure emanating from the sky from a crack within the sky fake kyoraku and fake ukitake appear ichigo tells rukia and renji to stay back as well as bring the other injured soul reapers uryu chad yumichika iba izuru hisagi and rangiku to orihime to be healed reigai kyoraku and reigai ukitake release their shikai and yamamoto does the same yamamoto tells ichigo to stay back as well stating they will only get in his way nozomi refuses and attacks fake kyoraku and fake ukitake but fails to land a strike ichigo spars with fake ukitake and nozomi with fake kyoraku meanwhile yamamoto was distracted and fake unohana activates several bakudo seals immobilizing him ichigo noticing nozomis defeat at fake kyorakus hands performs bankai ichigo fires a getsuga tensho at the attackers but fake ukitake uses his shikai to absorb and redirect it at him who barely manages to avoid it yamamoto destroys the seals with his reaitsu and the real unohana uses a bakudo on the reigai unohana the three fake captains all attack yamamoto but kagerosa appears commanding them to stop kagerosa battles yamamoto but the latter seems to have the upper hand nozomi offers to be a decoy for ichigo and yamamoto to prevent kagerosa from copying their techniques nozomi attacks kagerosa but the latter avoids crossing swords with the former as he is well aware of her abilities however nozomi reveals that her sword has already absorbed energy from yamamotos zanpakutou he avoids the attack from nozomi but yamamoto attacks him with his flames kagerosa manages to negate the flames with his zanpakutos abilities but it was only a diversion for ichigos getsuga tensho which is used on kagerosa ichigo collapses and nozomi tries to catch him but kagerosa is alive and reveals that before the impact of yamamotos ryujinjakka he copied nozomis abilities and use her absorbing ability to absorb both the attack of yamamotos ryujinjakka and ichigos getsuga tensho with ichigo gone kagerosa uses the combined attack to finish off yamamoto however nozomi appears before the blast in an attempt to absorb the attack  
nozomis zanpakuto breaks in the midst of trying to protect genryusai from kagerozas attack as ichigo and kon try to save nozomi from being taken away kageroza reveals to everyone that he and nozomi were created by the same reishi of another shinigami inaba defeats everyone while nozomi and kon run away nozomi sadly binds kon to a rock with kido and runs away without him ichigo is seen still conscious and struggling to catch up with nozomi nozomi is found by inaba who falls due to a loose rock on a slope ichigo finally catches up and defeats inaba with a getsuga tenshou only to discover that it was a clone of inaba created by his zanpakuto special ability inaba knocks ichigo out in one swipe and knocks nozomi out and proceeds to leave the world of the living with her kon still bound to a rock tries to follow them but is too late he is seen crying nozomis name while ichigos shihakusho turns white as a result of his depleting spirit energy  
following his defeat by kageroza ichigo has lost his shinigami powers still determined to save nozomi ichigo and his friends gather at uraharas shop to come up with a rescue plan urahara comes up with a risky plan that involves ichigo being swallowed by the kōtotsu to retrieve a sample of his shinigami powers since he was swallowed before the plan works and ichigo gets out of the kōtotsu when he meets up with everyone he states that he saw another him when he was inside the kōtotsu leading urahara to conclude that ichigo saved himself when he was first swallowedsince there is no time in the kōtotsu  
inside the precipice world rukia and the others act as decoys to draw away the reigais attention while ichigo urahara and kon break into the seireitei as they search for kagerozas laboratory urahara makes an attempt to restore ichigos lost shinigami powers by creating a mod soul candy but is discovered by the reigai of nemu and nanao at last minute before an explosion ichigo breaks the glass containing the candy and consumes it however as stated by urahara the candy was incomplete making the balance between ichigos shinigami and hollow powers unbalanced while escaping the three are ambushed by the reigai captains but are saved when yoruichi and the originals appear ready to fight  
the captains and lieutenants of the thirteen court guard squads thought to have fallen in battle return to fight the reigai meanwhile ichigos spirit energy and hollow powers continue to grow unstable forcing him to rest for the time being while urahara and kon continue there investigation on inaba urahara and kon later find out about yushima okouyo the shinigami who created inaba and nozomi when visiting yushimas cell in the maggots nest they get attacked by the reigais of soi fon and omaeda but are later defeated by urahara the two visit yushimas cell only to find him unresponsive leading urahara to conclude that yushima will never gain consciousness meanwhile ichigos hollow side finally takes over and escapes the building he was in  
urahara deduces where kagerozas other lab might be and he and kon head to that location only to be halted by a reigai of kisuke as urahara battles his reigai counterpart kon dashes down into the lab where he promptly tries to awaken nozomi inside her capsule she does awaken and at first insists that kon escape but after seeing his persistence and his devotion of trying to save her whom he considers a friend she tries to help kon restore ichigos spiritual pressue before ichigos soul capsule can be created however reigai nemu appears and stops the transfer immediately afterward the fusion process is complete hollow ichigo defeats the members of squad 8 and is about to destroy the reigai of ise when the fused yushima appears before him  
yushima shows no interest in fighting hollow ichigo and tries to walk away but the mindless hollow continues to pursue him leading them both to clash on sokyoku hill while the captains and their reigai counterparts are finally joined by their lieutenants who help them in the battle uryu renji rukia chad and orihime arrive on sokyoku hill and try to stop yushima but the combined powers of nozomi and kageroza prove to be too much for them yushima reveals the true nature of his zanpakuto and defeats everyone but before he can finish them off hollow ichigo jumps in front of rukia to take an attack that was meant for her  
yushimas zanpakuto stabs hollow ichigo and within his own consciousness he can see nozomi inside yushimas as well nozomi calls out to ichigo but before he can do anything to help her yushima regains his will and attacks him causing his hollow-self to break apart now powerless once again ichigo is left to watch as his friends attempt to overpower yushima but no matter what they try he finds a way to break through it yushima has reigai-nemu bring him something that will help the fusion become permanent and when she arrives she unexpectedly kicks him backward it is revealed that kon was helped by urahara and mayuri by placing his soul candy into that of the reigai kon gives ichigo a complete gikongan which he takes and it restores his shinigami powers he prepares to unleash his bankai against yushima meanwhile byakuya has deduced that the reigai do not sacrifice themselves to attack the originals when they are all together as it goes against what they and yushima believe in the originals join forces against the reigai to protect soul society  
ichigo successfully unleashes bankai and fights against yushima while the captains and vice-captains fight the reigai with the assistance of his friends ichigo is able to fire a hollowfied getsuga tenshou which yushima is unable to absorb because of his inability to absorb hollow reiatsu however his friends get defeated once again by yushima kon realizes that to break nozomis and inabas fusion ichigo will have to attack his soul sleep which contains a shinigamis powers as yushima strikes at ichigo he catches his zanpakuto and fires a huge hollowified getuga tenshou which causes great damage to yushima and the area nozomis consciousness appears again asking ichigo to kill her before he can do this yushima takes complete control and unleashes renzan hajokuri which creates a giant structure that absorbs the reishi from soul society being surrounded by his structure and ichigo out of the way nozomi regains control and creates a reishi sword to slice yushimas soul sleep the reigai react shockingly to yushimas attack and reveal that their motive was to protect soul society in their own way the reigai proceed to attack the yushimas effect at the cost of their own lives causing a huge explosion ichigo deactivates his bankai and has one last clash with an enraged yushima before breaking the fusion inaba and nozomi reappear again and inaba begins to question his thoughts to nozomi before fading away nozomi reuinites with kon and the rest of her friends before she starts fades away herself nozomi has a heartwarming goodbye with kon and everyone else and fades away  
gradually losing his temporarily restored powers ichigo struggles against a hollow but is saved by rukia the shinigami in charge of karakura town kuramadani zennosuke interrupts their conversation yelling at them to stop doing his job the next day rukia is instructed a mission by ukitake to prevent ichigo from fighting because of the fast rate of his disappearing spiritual powers that night ishida and rukia save ichigo from a hollow and tell him to rest much to his dismay the next day ichigo takes rukia and his friends to an ice skating rink since he saw rukia staring at the place a lot fireworks from a nearby amusement park begin to shoot up in the sky ending the day on a happy note while walking home ichigo senses a giant hollow and goes to his shinigami form before being stopped by rukia ichigo once again struggles against the giant hollow as his powers begin to fail him rukia saves him leaving ichigo to question if he was getting in her way rukia replies with a heartwarming speech about their friendship ichigo requests for rukia to freeze the hollows legs and he fires his last getsuga tenshou destroying the hollow ichigo exhausted has a brief conversation with rukia before he is told to rest ichigo wakes up in his human body in his room with his friends surrounding him ichigo takes note of his disappearing powers and asks to go outside outside ichigo notices that he can barely sense spirits anymore and even rukias presence is disappearing the two say goodbye and have a brief conversation before rukia begins to disappear from ichigos sight after rukia fully disappears ichigo thanks her  


japan 
seventeen months after the defeat of sōsuke aizen at the cost of his soul reaper powers ichigo kurosaki has been living in peace as a third year high-school student on the way home from school ichigo incapacitates a thief and returns the stolen bag to its owner the next day the thief and his gang seek out ichigo at his school and are confronted by uryū ishida elsewhere the owner of the stolen bag meets with his friends revealing he has found ichigo  
ichigo and uryū dispatch the gang with ease but are interrupted when ichigos part-time job boss kidnaps and forces him to work their client the owner of the stolen bag requests an investigation on isshin kurosaki ichigos father ichigo declines but is intrigued when the owner reveals his younger sister karin kurosaki had been visiting kisuke urahara the owner introduces himself as kugō ginjō gives ichigo a xcution business card and cryptically warns him to act before his family is hurt uryū passing by ichigos house pursues a strange man and is critically injured as a result  
while walking at night ichigo decides to forget his past and throws his substitute soul reaper badge into the river later he hears from orihime inoue that uryū is in the hospital at the hospital ryūken ishida sends ichigo home and reveals to orihime the assailant was a human with powers and cautions her to be careful the next day ichigos friends keigo asano and mizuiro kojima are attacked by the thief whom ichigo had stopped prior ichigo saves them and meets ishidas assailant who flees when ryūken arrives ichigo realizes he is being excluded from information due to his lack of powers and decides to contact xcution  
after contacting ginjō ichigo is lead to the xcution headquarters and learns its members possess the ability dubbed as fullbring which allows them to manipulate the souls of inanimate objects the cause of the power are residual reiatsu from hollows who attacked their pregnant mothers yasutora sado who had been missing appears at the headquarters shocking ichigo ginjō reveals xcution plans to restore ichigos soul reaper powers in order to rid themselves of their fullbring abilities ichigo declines stating he is only seeking information his family and friends are hiding from him  
uryūs assailant stabs an incomplete hollow and asks for its cooperation ichigo returns home and resumes his life chad attempts to convince ichigo to accept xcutions offer stating that ichigo himself wants the power to protect his loved ones while walking through town ichigo sees ishidas assailant and pursues him but runs into his sister yuzu kurosaki on the way the hollow attacks them and are saved when ginjō dispatches it as a result ichigo returns to xcution and accepts their offer and ginjō returns ichigos substitute soul reaper badge  
the next day ichigo is called in to xcution headquarters to learn how to use the fullbring ability ichigo is shrunken and placed in a dollhouse by xcution member riruka dokugamine where he has to defeat an aggressive stuffed animal with advice from chad ichigo uses his soul reaper badge as the focal item to materialize his fullbring  
ichigo defeats the stuffed animal with his fullbring and is freed from the dollhouse elsewhere orihime is confronted by moe shishigawara who intends to kill her shishigawara is then interrupted by his superior ishidas assailant who is revealed to be shūkurō tsukishima tsukishima prepares to punish shishigawara for going against his orders but orihime decides to intervene  
tsuskishima pretends to impale orihimes chest and leaves her although orihime suffered no cuts she starts having a vague idea that tsukishima was her friend unwilling to worry ichigo about what happened she only tells chad about tsukishima aware that orihime is hiding information from him ichigo goes back to xcution headquarters to continue his training to help his friends  
ichigo continues his fullbring training but desires to actually battle one of the members of xcution kugo suggests that jackie tristan be his opponent but she refuses and storms off meanwhile tsukishima sends shishigawara to tail chad and while chad is wary of his presence no attack on him is attempted later jackie decides that she will fight ichigo in a fish tank of riruka after seeing him pass the next part of his training she fully introduces herself activates her fullbring dirty boots and proceeds to attack a surprised ichigo  
ichigo continues his training with jackie tristan while at first jackie overwhelms him with her more experienced powers ichigo is able to activate a power of fullbring known as bringer light to gain the advantage as they go on with the battle ichigos powers go out of control but insist that he can still fight despite jackies insistence that they stop it is then that tsukishima attacks xcution wanting to kill ichigo but when tsukishima cuts the fish tank containing ichigo and jackie ichigo appears revealing the next stage of his fullbring  
ichigo and xcution start their battle with tsukishima the battle is taken outside when chad attacks tsukishima before he reveals he was the one who attacked uryū and orihime but ichigo finds it out anyway enraged he starts to battle tsukishima but the expert fullbringer overwhelms him kugo then gets in the way and battles with tsukishima instead the two being more evenly matched yet ichigo cant stand and watch and attacks again and is able to land a hit but is stopped by yukios fullbring invaders must die who then proceeds to stop tsukishima himself  
xcution continues their battle with tsukishima in order to make sure ichigo is fully protected by yukios fullbring they succeed and tsukishima is forced to retreat the group then moves to their second hideout to ponder what tsukishimas intentions were but come to realize they are overthinking it and decide to continue ichigos training inside yukios fullbring meanwhile orihime heals uryū and they discuss the new threat but are unable to figure out if all the incidents so far were from the same culprit orihime then runs into sado who brings her back to xcutions hideout to heal ichigo as he fights kugo kisuke urahara and isshin kurosaki are also working together on something and ask a soul reaper to put their reiatsu into a vat of spiritual pressure the soul reaper agrees and it is revealed to be none other than rukia kuchiki  
during the 17-month time skip the soul reapers of the soul society celebrate the new year told within 2 stories the first deals with izuru kira organizing a special event given to him by shuhei hisagi at first he is reluctant to participate but changes his mind after momo hinamoris interest in it the event he comes up with is friendly kite flying which slowly turns into a fight between women and men and squad 2 and 11 kira attempts to stop the chaos fail and he falls into squad 1s barracks angering head captain yamamoto the second deals with rukia as she prepares for an upcoming ceremonial dance her sister had been in many years ago but is unimpressed with her dancing abilities renji abarai decides to help her out but rukia is unable to discern what he is trying to do to actually help and when renji accidentally spills ink on the ceremonial kimono rukia angrily tells him to leave however after byakuya kuchiki gives rukia her sisters kimono instead she realizes that renji was trying to make sure rukia had some fun which would allow her to enjoy dancing instead of worrying about it rukia apologizes to renji through a letter and he is able to come to the dance which turns out to be a huge success  
ichigo continues his training with kugo ginjō while orihime heals him yet when kugo blinds him and starts to say antagonastic things to make ichigo angry ichigo begins to doubt kugos true intentions when ginjō claims he will kill chad and orihime ichigo is able to see notice his spiritual energy ichigo then manages to wound ginjō with his fullbring reaching its final level and ginjō apologizes for his acting  
after ichigo achieves the final level of fullbring he spends his time perfecting it with xcution deciding to protect ichigo so that they can complete their goal riruka goes to search chad and orihime who are investigating tsukishima riruka ends being ambushed by tsukishima who attacks her with his fullbring tsukishima then confronts chad and orihime who are unable to kill him as a result of tsukishimas fullbring causing him to be part of their memories  
after ichigo puts the finishing touches on completing his fullbring ginjō tells him to go home to see his sisters but tsukishima activates the fullbring he placed on ichigos friends and family in order to make them believe that tsukishima is a close relative of the kurosaki family after running out ichigo encounters ginjō who tells ichigo that all the other members of xcution have fallen under tsukishimas control  
while contemplating what to do next concerning tsukishimas fullbring ginjō and ichigo are found out by yukio and brought to tsukishima once there they are led up to the room where all of the people that were affected by tsukishimas fullbring are waiting for them unable to fight with all of them in the crosshairs ichigo runs away to a safer location but is stopped by the brainwashed xcution however kugo destroys the staircase and takes on the others himself while ichigo fights tsukishima he is able to gain the upper hand with his fullbring and severely injures tsukishimas arm however orihime and chad who are also affected by tsukishima arrive and stop him from finishing tsukishima off surprised by their sudden arrival tsukishima comes from behind and hits ichigo through the wall  
ichigo continues his battle with tsukishima but is unable to hurt him without fighting against orihime and chad who believe he has gone crazy meanwhile ginjō continues his battle with xcution but runs into trouble with moe shishigawara unable to fight back ichigo is overwhlemed by tsukishima and is about to be hit by his fullbring when ginjō takes the hit instead ichigo believes its all over but ginjō is unaffected they are about to continue the fight when uryu arrives ichigo wonders if he is affected by tsukishimas fullbring but uryu claims he is not and says that it was ginjō who attacked him before he can react ichigo is struck down by kugo who starts to laugh maniacally ichigo realizes that ginjō was affected after all but kugo says he is half right he was hit by tsukishima for a second time to return to his original self and stabs ichigo with his sword and says he will take his fullbring  
ginjō is able to take ichigos fullbring and apply its power to his own unable to do anything about his situation ichigo falls deep into despair and runs after ginjō demanding for ginjō to give him his power back ichigo is then impaled by a sword held by rukia which causes him to become a soul reaper once again the sword is revealed to possess the powers from the soul societys gotei 13 army in order to assist ichigo in his fight against ginjō ichigo attacks ginjō with a getsuga tensho which is powerful enough to clear away a thunderstorm and slice tsukishimas mansion in half  
ichigo continues to fight ginjō using his regained soul reaper powers overpowering ginjō ichigo then learns that he regained his powers thanks to all the captains and lieutenants giving him a piece of their own powers then ginjō reappears and tōshirō hitsugaya reveals that ginjō was the first substitute soul reaper meanwhile orihime and chad rush to ichigo and are confused as to why he and the other soul reapers are fighting ginjō tsukishima appears behind them and tries to break their minds by adding new memories to their past urahara and isshin knock them out the other members of xcution are given new powers of their own ichigo attempts to take them down but yukio uses his new powers to protect them and separate the others kenpachi zaraki quickly takes care of giriko and cuts him in half killing him instantly  
uryu comes to assist ichigo in his battle against ginjō byakuya kuchiki prepares to start fighting tsukishima while riruka ambushes rukia using stuffed animals renji abarai encounters jackie and defeats her without the use of his zanpakutō having trained to fight an opponent at aizens level as yukio then attempts to destroy the dimension where renji and jackie are situated he is confronted by hitsugaya hitsugaya manages to capture yukio in ice and attempts to force him to free his comrades meanwhile ikkaku madarame confronts shishigawara managing to find his fullbrings weakness and overpower him  
byakuya starts his battle with tsukishima when tsukishima reveals that he can use his fullbring on inanimate objects as well he traps byakuya and hits him and senbonzakura thus learning all he needs to know about byakuyas weaknesses meanwhile rukia fights against riruka and gets her body trapped in a stuffed animal due to rirukas new powers she attempts to fight with kido but it accidentally implodes inside herself riruka starts to reveal her past and xcutions past which gets her distracted enough for rukia to touch her zanpakuto unable to dodge rukia riruka is forced to use a special ability of her fullbring that causes her to vanish while rukia collapses meanwhile tsukishima is able to overwhelm byakuya and manages to inflict a serious injury however byakuya shoots out his bankai from his hand and it pierces tsukishimas chest byakuya thanks him for an exciting battle and tsukishima falls to the ground  
ichigo and uryu continue their battle with ginjō however when ginjō senses that tsukishima is near death he tells ichigo they have no longer have a reason to fight while revealing that the substitute soul reapers have been constantly spyed on by the soul society to monitor their actions however using his bankai to destroy the dimension with rukia and the soul reaper captains looking on ichigo admits knowing about the revelation yet still intends to trust soul society for aiding him in protecting the people close to him this has ginjō releases his own bankai in response to ichigos resolve as the two have a final clash  
the battle between ichigo and ginjō comes to a close when the latter receives a mortal wound just as ginjō is about to die the dying tsukishima tries to kill ichigo but is stopped by riruka as she emerges from rukias body shishigawa proceeds to carry tsukishima away while the other surviving xcution members decide to separate ichigo later returns to soul society and requests that head captain yamamoto let ginjōs body be buried within the human world as the last thing he can do for him yamamoto agrees just as ichigo accepts to continue being a substitute soul reaper rukia sees ichigo off recalling their time together and silently thanks him ichigo smiles and tells rukia see ya later before returning to karakura town where he is greeted by his friends and family notably before the episode ends ichigo breaks the fourth wall as he says see you again perhaps hinting the anime adaption will return in the future

the old clock store owner explains that to defeat quartzmon one of the digimon hunters must prove him/herself stronger than all the others to obtain the brave snatcher what remained of bagramon and infuse it with the powers of taiki and the five legendary heroes from other time-space universes who saved their respective digital worlds before sending tagiru ryouma and noborus teams and a few other hunters to a separate dimension the old clock store owner gives akari and zenjirou their own xros loaders so they and the reformed xros heart united army can help keep quartzmon at bay finding themselves fighting an army of myotismon clones which emerged from quartzmon xros heart forms shoutmon dx xrosupballistamon with deputymon xrosupdorulumon with pawnchessmon xrosuptsuwamon with superstarmon and xrosupmervamon with beelzemon the fight takes turn for the worse when some of the myotismon digivolve into malomyotismon and a group of venommyotismon just when the children are about to be defeated masaru and his agumon appear with taichi and agumon daisuke and magnamon takuya takato and guilmon from there the two agumons assume their mega forms while takato biomerges with guilmon to become dukemon while takuya becomes aldamon when magnamon reverts to veemon reinforcements arrive as yamato ken grani and takuyas team mates enable their leaders digimon to become omegamon imperialdramon dukemon crimson mode and susanoomon after having shinegreymon assume burst mode masaru supports Ωshoutmon in fighting some of the malomyotismon while imperialdramon assumes his fighter mode to finish off the venommyotismon meanwhile the other hunters step down from the dispute of who is the ultimate hunter with tagiru and ryouma fighting for the position after ryouma emerges the victor he successfully obtains the brave snatcher however just as the six heroes prepare to fight with ryouma and astamon to defeat quartzmon ryouma suddenly knocks down taiki and Ωshoutmon using the brave snatcher while revealing that he is actually allies with quartzmon whose true plan is mass genocide of humanity and making digiquartz the new human world  
though it seemed ryouma had betrayed the hunters astamon reveals to tagiru he is actually quartzmons terminal and has been manipulating ryouma the entire time once slide-evolving into his true form quartzmon reveals that he used ryouma to obtain enough digimon data to construct his main body before fusing into it and burrowing underground to digitize the earth for asborbing the old clock store owner has everyone gather around him to lend the power from their xros loaders while having clockmon temporaryily freeze time to halt quartzmons digitizing of all life on earth long enough for tagiru to obtain the brave snatcher taiki then passes his goggles to tagiru asking him to hunt quartzmon using the combined strength of himself and their predecessors while the others are digitized tagiru and arresterdramon proceed to hunt down quartzmon with the latter assuming superior mode and digi-xrossing with the brave snatcher to break quartzmons core at the root with quartzmon reduced to a digiegg and everything restored the digidestined tamers legendary warriors and dats agents return to their universes while the xros heart and hunter digimon return to their respective human and digital worlds however a month later gumdramon returns to the real world and is reunited with tagiru the old clock store owner appears in front of taiki and yuu cryptically revealing himself as a resurrected bagramon and that his reasons to helping them was amends for his role in quartzmons creation he also reveals that some digimon have remained in their world and tells them to be on their guard

lucy bathes with a magical lotion she created seven years ago only to find that its effects have changed over the years to turn her entire body invisible she turns to her friends for help but their attempts to make her visible again by painting on her and masking her fail eventually the lotions effects become so severe that they cause lucy to disappear together with everyones memories of her as if she had never existed fortunately natsu is able to remember his friendship with lucy allowing everyone to recall her back into existence as happy hugs lucy in joy however she accidentally spills the lotion bottle over everyone else turning all of them invisible

natsu and gajeel challenge the still-exiled laxus to a fight wendy suggests they have a showdown the next day in the hopes that they will calm down and lose interest but it only excites the rest of the guild who hold a festival for it almost as soon as their battle starts however laxus beats natsu with a single punch and gajeel runs away in fear while the rest of the town searches for gajeel the guild is visited by three figures resembling hughes sugar boy and coco from edolas meanwhile lucy decodes the writing on the relic with levys help and discovers that it is the hand of a legendary clock  
the three visiting wizards who turn out to be the earth-land counterparts of hughes a woman named mary hughes sugar boy and coco battle fairy tail and demand to hand lucy over to them michelle passes herself off as lucy to protect her prompting the rest of the guild to confuse the three into thinking that all of the females at fairy tail are lucy so she and michelle can escape however hughes chases the two and forces them off the edge of a cliff

fairy tail goes to the heartfilia mansion in search of clues for what legion wants with the clock hand they learn that legion is searching for pieces of the mystical clock following clues from two myths—one myth is the book from which lucy learned about the clock hand and the other is an enchanted picture book titled key of the starry heavens before they can leave with the book they are attacked by legions exceed leader samuel and his spearman dan straight who shrink natsu to minuscule size obtain the book and memorize its contents before leaving meanwhile lahar and his men encounter jackpot a serial arsonist who is burning down churches  
following clues from the picture book the members of fairy tail split into groups to search for the remaining pieces of the mystical clock before legion does lucys team is approached by a group of archaeologists interested in the clock who have heard rumors of fairy tails journey and try to dissuade her upon learning her identity and her resolution in following her fathers dying wish the head archaeologist who is familiar with lucys father has a change of heart and uses his teams magic to return natsu to his original size meanwhile lyon also learns of fairy tails exploits and joins gray and juvia  
natsu and lucys team finds an underground labyrinth in the middle of the desert they make their way past several booby traps as they descend until they reach a crypt at the bottom where they encounter coco and dan meanwhile grays team uncovers a parallel dimension where one of the clock parts is hidden sugar boy appears before them to take the part but grays team defeats him  
natsu and lucys team battles dan and coco as they search for the clock part in the underground crypt during their fight lucy and coco are separated from the others but help each other until they reunite with their comrades meanwhile gajeel helps levy and her team search for one of the clock parts in the mountains while erzas team enters an old library where they encounter the butt jiggle gang  
natsu has difficulty battling dan alone due to the power and skill dan accumulated over seven years with the help of his friends however he defeats dan and uncovers the clock part in an underground church meanwhile erza tries disciplining the butt jiggle gang while her teammates find the clock part in the library and defeats the gang after their flatulence ruins a flower she picked earlier concurrently samuel confronts gajeel and his team as they search for the next clock part

mary hughes uses her powers to extract mirajanes satan soul transformation from her body and uses it against her siblings however mirajane uses her forbidden halphas transformation against satan soul and defeats mary hughes meanwhile byro reveals to natsus team that legion is under orders from the archbishop of zentopia to gather and safeguard the clock parts from a magical guild that seeks to assemble it and form the infinity clock however natsus team find their motives suspicious and continue to battle him  
byro overpowers natsu with his ability to nullify all forms of magic though natsu and his friends determination moves coco into betraying legion before byro can defeat natsu the rest of the guild members arrive with the remaining clock parts guided to the crypt when the parts react to each other however gathering all six parts in one place causes the infinity clock to assemble itself with a reformed oración seis appearing alongside it  
led by midnight now calling himself brain ii the members of the reborn oración seis use their new powers to defeat both fairy tail and legion fairy tail is rescued by blue pegasus while the oración seis disappear with the infinity clock lucy rereads key of the starry heavens and realizes that her father entrusted her with the clock hand to prevent the clock from being constructed realizing that they were not supposed to collect the clock parts fairy tail sets out to stop both the oración seis and the infinity clock  
fairy tail learns that the oración seis are destroying churches as part of their plan to complete the infinity clocks power using canas divination the members of fairy tail split into new groups and head out to undestroyed churches where they find members of legion and the oración seis waiting for them meanwhile gildarts and laki investigate the long-abandoned plantation of michelles family legion adds the convict guttman to their ranks and lahar interrogates the zentopia cardinal lapointe about oración seiss recent escape from prison  
lahar enlists the help of doranbalt who has retired out of depression over his inability to help fairy tail on sirius island meanwhile natsu and wendys teams face off against oración seis jackpot and grim reaper formerly erigor of eisenwald respectively and gajeel and juvia find guttman and mary hughes attacking a church while gildarts and laki investigate a church filled with artificial priests and nuns  
lahar and doranbalt meet katja one of many celestial wizards tasked with guarding an unknown force that the oración seis are hunting racer appears before them and after fighting doranbalt uses a spell called anti-link to permanently sever katjas power weakening the seal to their target meanwhile wendy defeats the brainwashed erigor and restores his memories gray and erzas teams battle angel and cobra respectively and gildarts and laki discover the comatose body of a girl named michelle bringing the identity of the michelle with natsus group into question  
the members of the oración seis stop fighting fairy tail and resume their mission of casting anti-links on the celestial wizards hidden in churches completely lifting the seal on the infinity clocks true form a massive clockwork dreadnought byro meanwhile tells natsus team of his orders from lapointe to bring lucy to zentopias archbishop with oración seiss plan complete michelle reveals her true identity as a member of oración seis imitatia who posed as lucys relative to manipulate fairy tail into helping them she also reveals her authority as archbishop given to her by the real one forcing byro to follow her orders and kidnaps lucy  
natsu is imprisoned in zentopia cathedral along with the butt jiggle gang but later manages to break free and brings coco along as well meanwhile lucy is pinned into a device while the oracion seis prepare to activate real nightmare the magic that the infinity clock contains the group of archaeologists that lucy previously encountered whose leader revealed to be the descendant of will neville and an acquaintance of jude heartfilia show up at the guild and ask fairy tail to stop the clock later ichiya comes with the redesigned christina to bring erza gray elfman mirajane wendy and warren to zentopia cathedral racer appears in the airship and mirajane decides to battle him  
the infinity clock turns out to be affecting the time state of humans mirajane defeats racer and ichiya fights kanaloa which byro sends out just as the airship arrives at the zentopia cathedral natsu and coco encounters guttman but mary hughes comes to aid them and decides to take him on by herself gildarts and laki gets to the archbishops room first and finds out that the archbishop is being controlled by cardinal lapointe byro overhears this and rushes to face lapointe off  
the reason why lucy is kidnapped is that since the infinity clock needs celestial wizards to seal it the one that can control it should be a celestial wizard as well led by coco natsu gray erza gajeel and elfman set off to the infinity castle to defeat the oracion seis in order to change the ownership of the clock so they can stop it and save lucy however cobra angel and midnight interfere causing erza gray and gajeel take on each of them respectively lapointe is actually a doll created by personification magic using master zeros hair gildarts somehow manage to defeat byro  
as lucy is slowly being sucked within the infinity clock imitatia faces off against natsu elfman and coco in addition every other member of fairy tail starts working to stop the infinity clock from bringing forth chaos and to find the runaway kinana erza and cobra continue their match gray and dan straight face off against angel whose self-titled magic proves to be more dangerous for her than it is for her opponents  
while erza concludes her battle with cobra lucy is slowly becoming part of the infinity clock the process has already begun and hope is lost until the archbishop who regains consciousness comes up with a way to slow down the process destroying the chains linking to earth land legion and fairy tail cooperate in order to stop brain ii and destroy the clocks chains meanwhile brain ii tells imitatia that should lucy be fully merged with the clock all memory of lucy will vanish horrified imitatia rushes to save lucy only to be reverted by brain ii into her true form a doll lucy owned as a child  
natsu finally manages to defeat midnight when the wizard overestimates his ability to control the entirety of the infinity clock by himself as the dark guilds possession of the clock is revoked lucy floats inside the golden liquid of the clock remembering her childhood and connection to her doll michell as she hears her friends calling her lucy tries to escape the clock and is able to do so with the help of jean-luc and the others at the fairy tail guild sending out blue shooting stars to find and return those affected by anti-link to their normal selves lucy is separated from the clock and falls from the sky being caught by natsu and reuniting with her guild at last her adventure surrounding her fathers memento at an end

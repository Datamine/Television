babidi enters the spaceship but dabura suddenly flies over to the z fighters and he kills kibito kai goku and vegeta take some shots at him but they miss dabura spits on krillin and piccolo turning them both to stone the only way to revive them is to kill dabura this lures the warriors into the ship upon arrival they meet babidis henchman pui pui who tells them that they must fight a different opponent on each level of the spaceship and as they are beaten up their energy will be absorbed by the room and injected into the ball that contains buu  
vegeta starts to beat up pui pui with no effort to give his fighter the advantage babidi changes the room to mimic pui puis home planet where the gravity is ten times that of earths unfortunately for pui pui vegeta trains at five hundred times of earths gravity and he easily destroys pui pui they move on to the second level where goku will fight babidis pet monster yakon  
goku and yakon start to fight goku is obviously stronger than yakon so babidi changes the environment to mimic the planet of darkness which is yakons home planet to help himself see goku becomes a super saiyan yakon the devourer of light sucks up the light emitting from goku seeing this goku again becomes a super saiyan allowing yakon to suck up all the light energy he can finally he becomes a super saiyan 2 and gives off a flash of brilliant energy which is too much for yakon to handle victorious the fighters head to the next level  
the fighters move to the third level this time its gohans turn to fight dabura decides that he will fight this time but first he goes to the meditation chamber to prepare meanwhile back at the world martial arts tournament only five fighters remain because the rest of them flew away hercule decides to finish the tournament with all five remaining fighters in the ring at the same time 18 takes out one of them and mighty mask composed of goten and trunks takes out another now its down to those two and hercule  
18 and mighty mask goten and trunks start to fight and because they are able to use their arms and legs simultaneously as mighty mask they have the upper hand against 18 but when she steps up the intensity they cant keep up with her so they decide to turn into super saiyans this of course blows their cover and they are disqualified now it is down to 18 and hercule meanwhile dabura has finally finished his meditation and is ready to fight gohan  
18 gets hercule in a headlock and she uses the opportunity to cut him a deal shell throw the match if he pays her double what he wins for the title he reluctantly agrees and the fight soon ends with hercule as the victor over in babidis spaceship dabura finally emerges ready to fight babidi sends them to a planet similar to earth so their fight wont damage the ship as their battle begins gohan finds that dabura is a tough opponent so he revs up his power to super saiyan level  
gohan and dabura continue fighting and from the outset it is clear that gohan has lost his edge he hasnt trained for seven years he was even stronger when he was a kid dabura is beating him fairly easily and vegeta starts to lose his cool noticing this dabura tells babidi to return them all to the ship he privately informs babidi that vegeta has a terrible rage burning inside him and that he could be made to serve their purposes meanwhile goten and trunks see videl flying back to the stadium and she tells them all about whats happening excited at the prospect of seeing magic and a wizard although they reveal that they dont even know what a wizard is they race off after the others  
goku gohan vegeta and the supreme kai are left wondering why dabura suddenly stopped the fight suddenly babidi tries to take over vegetas mind although he is urged to fight it babidis magic is too strong and vegetas impure heart gives in now with babidis m on his forehead he has turned evil babidi transports them all back to the world martial arts stadium where he instructs vegeta to kill his friends vegeta refuses as he apparently has not lost complete control of his mind he says that his only goal is to fight goku to bait goku into fighting him vegeta destroys part of the stadium killing many fans  
goku refuses to fight vegeta so vegeta destroys another part of the stadium to avoid any further casualties goku reluctantly agrees to fight the supreme kai tries to stop him but he sees that it is no use goku tells babidi to transport them far away from people and the wizard obliges the supreme kai and gohan decide to break into the next level of the ship and try and stop babidi to avoid this babidi commands vegeta to kill the supreme kai but vegeta refuses though babidi is possessing him vegeta can only focus on one thing fighting goku goku gives gohan one of the last two senzu beans before he and the supreme kai go further into the ship vegeta and goku power themselves up to their maximum level and are ready to fight  
goku and vegeta start to fight and their raw power is astounding both fighters possess incredible ability and so far the fight seems to be a draw vegeta is able to lock goku to a boulder with cuffs made of energy he tells goku how he has stolen his royal destiny by beating frieza and becoming a super saiyan first and how insulting it was to be surpassed in power by the child gohan goku is able to break free and the battle resumes with crushing force meanwhile gohan and the supreme kai have made it all the way to buus ball but babidi and dabura are waiting for them  
goku and vegeta continue their battle vegeta reveals that he knew he could never surpass gokus strength so he allowed himself to be taken over by babidi he had seen what it had done to spopovich and yamu and he wanted the power for himself he also says that he wanted babidi to reawaken the evil in his heart over the years he had become like a normal person he had a wife and a son and thought the earth was a nice place to live he wanted babidis magic to free him from those petty attachments but goku doesnt believe him meanwhile before gohan and the supreme kai can stop babidi buu has finally gathered enough energy and has begun to hatch  
in an attempt to abort the hatching gohan begins firing kamehameha waves at the ball but it doesnt seem to do much good the ball opens but after some pink steam escapes there is nothing left in the ball they believe that gohan destroyed buu with his energy blasts but suddenly the pink steam begins to congeal it forms into majin buu instead of a fearsome beast buu is a fat pink child but the supreme kai knows that it is really majin buu and not something else goku and vegeta have noticed the sudden upsurge in power and realize that buu has been hatched  
dabura insults majin buu and with a single blow buu dispatches with the king of the demons goku and vegeta feel buus surge of power and goku convinces vegeta to postpone the fight until they can take out buu vegeta says he doesnt want goku distracted while theyre fighting as goku is preparing to leave vegeta knocks him out with a blow to the head and takes the final senzu bean and promises to kill buu himself babidis first order to majin buu is to kill gohan and the supreme kai gohan grabs shin and takes off but even with their head start buu catches up to them with blinding speed with a single blow buu puts gohan out of commission leaving the supreme kai unguarded  
the supreme kai defends himself as best he can against buu but he is no match for him buu pounds the supreme kai into the ground and is preparing to eat him when gohan flies in and knocks buu away gohans recovery is short-lived because buu hits him with an energy blast of incredible power as gohan falls to the earth in a forest somewhere he is very badly injured goten and trunks arrive at the outskirts of the scene and notice the statues of piccolo and krillin trunks accidentally breaks the piccolo statue as buu is preparing to eat shin dabura suddenly throws a spear through him dabura warns babidi that he will soon lose control of buu and his monster will turn on him babidi doesnt believe him and now buus plans have changed dabura is next on the menu  
dabura tries his best to destroy buu but he is nowhere near strong enough to do the job buu turns him into a cookie and eats him with dabura gone krillin and piccolo despite his statue being slightly broken are able to come back to life just as buus about to eat the supreme kai vegeta makes his presence known by destroying babidis spaceship vegeta knows what buu did to gohan and he vows that when goku regains consciousness this will all be over even if it costs him his own life he promises to atone for what hes done and he powers up at full strength he ferociously attacks buu  
though incredibly powerful vegetas attacks do nothing to majin buu he even blasts a hole in the monster but buu is able to regenerate his body tired of playing around buu rocks the entire planet by powering up he then rips off part of his own belly and is able to wrap it around vegeta trapped the saiyan prince can do nothing to defend himself trunks cant stand to see his father tortured like this so he powers up and jets off to help him and goten follows  
trunks knocks buu away from his father and he and goten free vegeta from his bonds piccolo attacks babidi and despite the wizard using all of his magic to defend himself piccolo is able to slice him in half vegeta recovers and tells trunks that he is proud of him for the first time vegeta embraces his son he then knocks out goten and trunks allowing piccolo to carry them away to safety with buu back and ready for more vegeta makes the ultimate sacrifice he erupts in a blinding flash of light certainly killing anything near him including himself the last pure blood saiyan is now dead  
after vegetas eruption piccolo returns to the scene of the battle he finds no sign of vegeta left and that buu has been blasted into thousands of small pieces he also finds the top half of babidi who is begging for help suddenly the pieces of buu begin to reform they all combine to make majin buu whole again knowing hes outmatched piccolo retreats buu heals babidi and the two embark on a killing spree piccolo catches up with krillin telling him that the worlds last hope goten and trunks must be protected krillin is instructed to take the two young saiyans to dendes lookout meanwhile the suprem kai has recovered and is searching for gohan  
yamcha 18 bulma videl and chi chi among others go looking for the dragon balls their search for the seventh one leads them to a nest full of eggs but before bulma can grab it a dinosaur eats the entire nest yamcha hits the beast with an energy ball which causes it to fly into the ocean videl goes swimming after it and with a little help from master roshi they are able to extract the ball piccolo and krillin arrive at the lookout with the unconscious goten and trunks soon after goku regains consciousness and appears at the lookout himself  
while discussing tactics goku reveals that he knows of a method by which two similar-sized people can fuse together into one ultimate being they decide that goten and trunks will learn this new trick but the only problem is that it will take about a week to learn it and goku has less than a day left on earth piccolo decides to teach the boys after goku is gone suddenly the sky turns black and they realize that bulma is calling the dragon goku uses instant transmission to appear at capsule corp but she has already made one wish her wish was to bring back everyone that died today goku tells shenron that they will postpone their second wish and uses instant transmission to take everyone there back to the lookout with him meanwhile kibito kai awakens because of the wish and the supreme kai is still searching for gohan  
kibito kai finds the supreme kai and heals him then both of them find gohan and decide to take him to the world of the kais meanwhile back at the lookout goku breaks the news about vegeta and gohan to the everyone as both of them are believed to be dead as expected everyone is shocked chi-chi faints bulma screams for vegeta and videl cries and refuses to believe gohan is dead they are just about to wake trunks and goten when babidi suddenly starts a global announcement he tells everyone that he and majin buu will terrorize the entire planet until piccolo goten and trunks show themselves to give them a taste of whats in store he shows buu turning the entire population of a major city into small candies which he greedily consumes  
babidi tells the earth that anyone with any information about piccolo goten or trunks should tell him to stop any further damage piccolo wants to turn himself in but goku convinces him not to because he knows that even if the three turn themselves it it wont stop buus destruction goten and trunks wake up and they learn about vegeta and gohans supposed demise goku is harsh with them because they cant waste any time mourning right now the boys although angry at goku for not saving gohan and vegeta know that they must be tough to stop majin buu in the world of the kais kibito kai heals gohan and the supreme kai tells him about the z sword it is a mystical sword that contains great power and even the kais themselves could not pull it from the rock it is now stuck in the supreme kai believes that gohan possesses the strength to do so  
gohan attempts to free the z sword but cant do it in his normal state he transforms into a super saiyan and with a mighty heave he frees the sword from the rock to his great surprise the sword is incredibly heavy and he must now train himself to use it back on earth babidi and buu continue their reign of terror and goten and trunks tell him that theyre going to destroy him and buu  
goten and trunks begin their fusion training but it is soon interrupted by babidi he announces that he has learned where trunks lives and he and buu are now on their way to kill him goku sends trunks to get the dragon radar from capsule corporation before it is destroyed and he himself heads off to slow down buu and babidi he asks buu why he takes orders from someone as weak as babidi though buu seems intrigued by the thought of killing his master he dislikes goku as much as he does babidi so he decides to attack goku goku knows that an ascended super saiyan isnt enough to stop buu so he says hell take it up to the next level  
to buy as much time as possible goku demonstrates the super saiyan transformations he starts in his normal form then goes to super saiyan then super saiyan 2 he then transforms into super saiyan 3 and the immense power of this transformation rocks the entire planet his hair grows down to his knees and his eyes change his power is so incredible that gohan the supreme kai and kibito kai can feel it in the world of the kais as a super saiyan 3 he possesses even more power than majin buu he starts to pound buu with relative ease at capsule corporation trunks and dr brief frantically search for the dragon radar  
goku continues his awesome display of power but with each blow to majin buu the monster gets even more powerful he seems to have an unlimited well of energy to use bulma calls trunks on videls cell phone to tell him that she left the dragon radar in the airplane he retrieves the radar and heads back to the lookout goku senses this and decides to end his fight with buu he once again tells buu that hes much too skilled to be taking orders from babidi goku instantly transmits himself back to the lookout this time buu takes gokus advice and turns on his master he executes babidi meanwhile gohan continues his training with the z sword  
without babidi to control him majin buu goes on a spree of destruction trunks returns to the lookout with the dragon radar baba shows up to tell goku that he only has thirty minutes left his transformation into super saiyan 3 was very draining and it ate up a lot of his time that was left even though he is exhausted he begins teaching goten and trunks the fusion dance on the world of the kais gohan begins training with even more intensity than before determined to save the universe from majin buu  
buu clears some space in the countryside and builds a house for him to live in goten and trunks continue learning the fusion dance and begin to master the technique they each plead with goku for him to show them the super saiyan 3 transformation and because he knows his time is up goku complies soon after the transformation baba shows up to take him away goku says goodbye to everyone at the lookout once again he is gone  
back in other world goku visits king yemma to ask him if hes seen gohan king yemma says that gohan has not checked in thrilled that his son is still alive he searches for his energy signal and uses instant transmission to go there he starts to help gohan with his training with the z sword piccolo continues training goten and trunks to fuse buu happens upon a blind kid named tommy who doesnt seem to be scared of him buu restores the kids vision but to his surprise the child is not afraid of him he is grateful that buu made him see and considers buu a friend buu seems to like friendship more than fear  
goku throws a giant boulder at gohan to test his abilities with the z sword gohan makes a clean cut so the supreme kai conjures up a block of the hardest metal in the universe this time the sword cant cut it and breaks under the pressure but from out of the z sword comes the elder kai who is fifteen generations older than shin in exchange for a date with bulma the elder kai agrees to awaken gohans sleeping powers he starts to do a strange dance in circles around the saiyan and says that it will take 5 hours to awaken his sleeping power meanwhile goten and trunks have finally mastered the fusion dance and are ready to attempt it for real  
goten and trunks attempt to fuse and their first attempt yields a weird-looking fat kid with very little power their second attempt creates an old emaciated weakling finally the two are perfectly in sync and make gotenks piccolo tells him to wait thirty minutes for the fusion to wear off so they can try it as super saiyans gotenks thinks hes powerful enough already and takes off to find majin buu he is able to get some hits in on the monster but when buu steps up the intensity gotenks is no match and is easily defeated meanwhile on the world of the kais the elder kai continues the long ceremony needed to awaken gohans hidden power  
goten and trunks heal up from their injuries they will train the rest of the day and fight majin buu tomorrow at full strength on the world of the kais the elder kai has finished his five-hour ritual now gohan must sit and meditate for twenty more hours for his power to awaken back at buus house hercule arrives to defeat the evil creature he tries some tricks with poison candy and exploding video games but they have no effect on the monster buu decides to be friends with hercule  
goten and trunks successfully fuse as super saiyans but once again their ego takes over gotenks spends all of his time flying around the earth at full speed and by the time he decides to attack buu his 30 minutes are up back at buus house hercule is doing his best to please the monster he even cooks him dinner while away murdering people buu finds an injured dog and heals him buu discovers the joys of friendship with this dog and when hercule tells buu that killing is bad buu vows never to kill again but while buu and his pet are playing fetch two crazed gunmen shoot the dog  


 japan 
the two gunmen proceed to shoot rockets at buus house hercule runs up to the hill theyre on and pounds each of them buu is able to heal the dog and the three friends continue having fun buu rebuilds his house to look like the dog which he names bee while hercule is cooking a meal for buu one of the gunmen sneaks into buus house and shoots the world champ buu starts to lose control of himself after he heals hercule he instructs him to get away buu begins giving off more steam than ever and the steam is congealing in the sky it forms the evil side of buu a tall thin gray version of majin buu evil buu flies over to the gunman and blasts him into oblivion  
evil buu and good buu begin to fight and its clear that evil buu has the advantage good buu becomes desperate and angry and resorts to trying to turn his opponent into chocolate but evil buu deflects the ray back at good buu who becomes a piece of chocolate evil buu consumes the chocolate and transforms into super buu a bulkier pink version of evil buu super buu blows up the other gunman and spies another person hiding nearby he is about to destroy the other person when he realizes that its hercule he spares his friend and flies off he arrives at dendes lookout  
buu demands to fight gotenks but piccolo knows that the boys arent ready to buy time he tells buu that he can spend a day killing the rest of the people on earth buu starts walking around the edge of the lookout and piccolo uses this time to tell krillin to wake up the boys and get them into the hyperbolic time chamber to train buu completes his walk and raises up his arm millions of energy blasts start flying out of his hand down to earth and they kill virtually everyone left after this human extinction attack is finished only hercule the dog bee tien shinhan and chiaotzu remain on the surface as well as the people on the lookout piccolo asks for super buu to wait for one hour and videl agrees buu complies because videl is the daughter of hercule  
chi chi slaps super buu for she thinks he killed gohan and in retaliation buu turns her into an egg and crushes her goten vows to train as hard as he can for what buu did to his mother the boys enter the hyperbolic time chamber and begin to train buus patience wears off after thirty minutes and he demands to fight his opponent right now piccolo reluctantly agrees to take buu to the chamber but he takes the longest route possible giving the boys as much time as he can he telepathically warns them that he is bringing buu to them so they can rest up in time the boys seem to have developed a few new tricks and they have planned their fight with buu finally piccolo and buu arrive at the chamber and goten and trunks fuse together  
super buu and gotenks begin to fight and gotenks decides to use some of his new special moves the problem is that these moves while flashy are ineffective against buu not to mention they have ridiculous names like the screaming angry wombat after it is clear that these moves have no effect gotenks talks strategy with piccolo he then creates a ring of energy the galactic doughnut and uses it to trap buu after a brief struggle buu is able to break the ring the two then do a bit of real fighting gotenks decides to use another one of his special moves called the super ghost kamikaze attack he spits out a ghost of himself and plans to use it against buu  
gotenks creates ten ghosts that detonate with explosive force when they are touched he sends all but one at super buu and they reduce him to a deformed puddle of his former self gotenks sends the final one down buus mouth blowing him into tiny pieces gotenks and piccolo destroy all of the pieces but the smoke coming from the pieces gathers above their heads and reforms super buu to play up the drama of the situation gotenks acts like hes out of ideas and buu begins beating up the fused saiyan thinking that gotenks cannot stop buu piccolo destroys the door to the outside world which traps the three of them in the chamber for all eternity  
hysterically upset at the prospect of being trapped in the hyperbolic time chamber forever with nothing to destroy and no candy to eat super buu starts to scream to everyones surprise including his own his screams become so powerful that they create a hole in the barrier between the dimensions of the chamber and earth buu changes shape in order to fit through it and the hole closes leaving piccolo and gotenks trapped back on the lookout buu is hungry and excited at the prospect of turning more people into food and so he turns everyone on the lookout into chocolate piccolo and gotenks have been attempting to scream loud enough to create an inter-dimensional hole like buu did but they have no success gotenks decides to play his trump card transforming into a super saiyan 3 in this state he has the power necessary to create a hole for him and piccolo to jump through upon their return to the lookout buu tells gotenks that he ate all of his friends and enraged gotenks promises buu that he will pay  
gotenks and super buu begin to fight and the collateral damage from the battle begins to destroy the lookout buu slams gotenks down through the lookout itself down on earth gotenks tries another super ghost kamikaze attack but it once again fails buu lands a powerful hit on gotenks that sends him flying back into the lookout buu then folds himself into a ball and begins repeatedly shooting himself through the lookout until all thats left is rubble floating in the air while still in a ball gotenks is able to trap him in a little sphere he and piccolo then play some volleyball with buu and gotenks spikes him down to earth just when it seems like buu is dead a powerful blast of energy comes from the crater with buu once again ready to fight gotenks only has a few minutes until he separates  
gotenks and buu continue their fight gotenks seems to be wearing buu down and he now has the upper hand in the fight just as hes about to hit buu with his final move gotenks unexpectedly returns straight to his normal state from his super saiyan 3 form the power was too high for him to sustain buu begins beating up gotenks who is now no match for him gohan has finally finished his training and is ready to return to earth after saying goodbye to goku for what they both believe will be the last time kibito takes him back and gohan asks him to change his clothes hes now wearing clothes just like goku he arrives just in time because gotenks has separated  
gohan arrives at the scene and everyone is shocked at how much power he has after gohan expertly pounds him to a pulp buu heals himself and steps up the intensity but gohan still has the upper hand he is easily picking buu apart  
realizing that hes totally outmatched buu decides to self-destruct hoping to take gohan with him gohan escapes before buu explodes and he takes the others with him out of the blast radius afterwards there is no sign of buu but gohan knows that hes still around they suddenly detect dendes energy signal and they go to find him on the way they pick up hercule satan and the dog bee dende explains that as buu was escaping through the inter-dimensional hole mr popo threw him from the lookout because without dende there would be no dragon balls to grant the wishes they intend to use to reverse all the damage buu tracks them down but instead of having a rematch with gohan he calls out goten and trunks  
unknown to the others buu secretly separates two chunks from his back and the two pink blobs creep around behind the others as soon as goten and trunks fuse one of the blobs encases gotenks piccolo too has been covered by a pink blob buu calls each of the blobs back to him which merge with him changing his appearance and giving him access to all of piccolos and gokenks memories abilities and power the new and improved super buu then fights gohan and its clear that buu has the advantage gohan is unable to keep up with buus new speed and strength buu taunts gohan by telling him what his three friends that were absorbed think of him  
gohan is no match for the new super buu buu now possesses new skills such as the super ghost kamikaze attack and the special beam cannon each of which he uses on gohan he is about to finish gohan when bee comes running up hercule tries to save bee but is only several times stronger than the average human - nothing compared to buu buu is about to blast each of them when gohan saves them buu then uses gotenks galactic doughnut trick on gohan and aims a kamehameha wave at him but gohan is able to summon enough strength to break free and move out of the way in time meanwhile in other world king yemma decides to send vegeta back to earth to help in the fight against majin buu on the world of the kais the elder kai decides to give his life to goku so he can return to earth and fight buu the now deceased elder kai gives goku his earrings he explains to goku that if he and another person each wear one they will fuse together  
elder kai tells shin and kibito to try a fusion with their earrings but only after they fuse together does he reveal that it is a permanent fusion dende heals gohans injuries so to prevent this from happening again buu creates a giant energy ball and aims it at dende just before it hits it is deflected by tiens tribeam attack who has decided to help even though he is terribly outclassed buu tries again but goku suddenly appears and sends a disk of energy at the monster it cuts off his legs and part of his head his legs deal tien a crushing kick which completely incapacitates him and then they return to buu desperate to stop majin buu goku throws gohan the other earring but his aim is off and the earring is lost in the rubble goku goes super saiyan 3 in an attempt to hold buu off while gohan searches for the earring inside super buu gotenks fusion wears off splitting back into trunks and goten causing buu to lose well over a third of his power and his appearance to change realising whats happened goku declares he can now defeat majin buu without fusing with gohan and prepares to fight knowing he needs a massive power increase buu causes the part of his head that was cut off earlier to suddenly engulf gohan just like piccolo and gotenks he reabsorbs the blob containing gohan and is now even more powerful than he was with gotenks absorbed  
now back in control buu toys with goku telling him he has some time to find someone to fuse with he considers fusions with dende and hercule but neither of them are appealing possibilities he suddenly senses that vegeta has returned and uses instant transmission to teleport to his location while buu is distracted dende heals tien after goku finds vegeta goku tries to convince him to fuse but vegeta is angry at goku because he knows goku was holding back his super saiyan 3 transformation when they fought with vegeta refusing to cooperate they are forced to take on buu as individuals but are clearly outclassed goku tells vegeta that buu absorbed trunks and killed bulma and asks him to put their differences aside to save their people vegeta finally agrees and only when he puts the earring on does goku mention that the fusion is permanent the two last surviving saiyans fuse and a new being is created  
the new being names himself vegito and begins to fight buu he clearly is far superior to even the new super buu in other world bulma videl chi chi and dabura are looking for gohan whom they mostly believe to be dead when dabura arrived at the check-in station he resisted the guards attempts to subdue his aggressive behaviour and knowing dabura would enjoy being sent to hell king yemma turned him good back on earth dende and hercule arrive at the battle scene just as buu has decided to destroy the earth he creates a massive ball of energy and throws it towards the earth vegito easily catches it and deflects it back out into space buu claims that he has yet to fight at his full power vegito says the same and powers up to a super saiyan  
now calling himself super vegito he continues to thrash majin buu buu tries to hide himself with his own steam to gain the advantage but vegito continues to batter him on the grand kais planet krillin and yamcha are training with king kai back on earth buu is starting to become desperate he liquifies himself and shoots down vegitos mouth entering his body and turning him into what looks like a super-muscular version of himself while inside vegito buu takes control of his body and boasts that he will use him to destroy him from the inside but vegito uses his energy to isolate all of buu into one spot and pound him buu moves around but vegito simply continues to pound him buu is forced to exit vegitos body realising he doesnt know how he can save himself super majin buu begins to freak out and the immense amount of energy he releases into his surroundings threatens to tear apart the universe itself realising this vegito tries to stop him but buu has put up a shield around himself after a long struggle vegito breaks through the shield and stops buu  
vegito and buu continue to fight and vegito is still far more powerful than his opponent he repeatedly dominates buu which makes buu angrier and angrier vegito is just toying with him buu hatches a plan and calls vegito out vegito comes closer and buu turns him into candy meanwhile videl bulma chi chi and dabura continue their search for gohan videl still doesnt believe that gohan is dead  
as buu celebrates his apparent victory the vegito candy unexpectedly begins to attack buu it turns out that vegito is somehow still in full control of his new candy body and that he is just as powerful as he was before and can even still talk albeit in a higher pitch the candy vegito is just as fast as super vegito and due to its tiny size is impossible for buu to hit infuriated at being toyed with by a piece of candy buu changes it back into vegito who then continues to beat him up vegito literally starts tearing buu apart he gives buu until the count of ten until he destroys him and during this countdown buu notices a part of himself that vegito tore off down on the ground this part rises up behind vegito and before vegito reaches ten he is engulfed by the pink blob buu calls the blob back to him and absorbs it  
after absorbing vegito buu notices that he has not taken on any of his characteristics he guesses this is because he hasnt digested vegito yet inside buu vegito still exists intact and separate from buu it turns out that vegito had planned this putting up a barrier during the absorption and letting himself be shrunk by buus magic absorption process but not incorporated into his being once he dispels the barrier vegito unexpectedly splits back into goku and vegeta taking advantage of this unexpected event vegeta crushes his fusion earring not wanting to give up his independence from goku by permanently fusing with him he cites that once they free their absorbed friends buu will lose most of his power and they wont need to be fused to defeat him as they journey through his innards they encounter tiny green pieces of slime the slime starts to attack and it completely covers goku electrocuting and paralysing him suddenly a giant worm appears ready to eat goku  
goku shakes off the slime and blasts the worm injuring it the worms brother then shows up and comically calls for their father but instead of eating goku the father yells at his mischievous sons goku and the daddy worm exchange pleasantries while vegeta feels comically sick due to the worms the worms point them in the right direction but due to the damage goku and vegeta have caused inside buu buu experiences great discomfort and decides to evacuate his bowels buu creates a toilet in the middle of nowhere and comically stinks out the surrounding area including dende and hercule satan goku vegeta and the worms are caught up a surge of liquid rushing through buus innards and the worms declare its potty time a horrified vegeta refuses to be expelled from buus body in such a way he blasts a hole through the wall of whatever fluid tube they are sliding down and flies up through it with goku following after a long journey they finally arrive in buus head where they encounter what appear to be piccolo gohan and gotenks these three begin attacking goku and vegeta and even though goku and vegeta manage to defeat their mysterious attacks they just get back up again and continue fighting it seems goku and vegeta cannot win but when buu goes to a bakery and begins to eat some cake the unstoppable opponents turn into desserts they were just buus thoughts goku and vegeta finally find their four friends who are trapped in cocoons unconscious but alive  
goku and vegeta cut down their four friends and as they do super buu regresses to his normal form dende and hercule continue to follow buu back inside majin buu goku and vegeta also find the fat majin buu they read his thoughts to find out what happened to him suddenly a thought form of super buu himself appears the two join forces to defeat it but once they do another one appears they realize that this is a battle they cannot win buu finally decides that hes had enough and he tries to absorb goku and vegeta  
goku saves vegeta from being absorbed as vegeta recovers goku continues to fight the thought form of super buu goku is rapidly losing energy and just as super buu is about to defeat goku vegeta cuts down the pod containing the fat majin buu this causes super buu to go mad as without the fat majin buu absorbed super buu cannot exist as super buus insides begin to change goku and vegeta realise they must leave and so they grab the pods containing gohan goten piccolo and trunks and try to find a way out on their way through his body they notice one of the tunnels that leads to one of the holes in buus skin where the steam escapes they are able to fly out through here and when they emerge on the other side all six of them regain their normal size as goku and vegeta set the pods down they observe super buu changing into a different being he first transforms into a hulking form and then shrinks into a childlike version of himself  
supreme kai explains to the elder kai that he was once one five supreme kais he was one of the four that each ruled over a quadrant of the universe and the fifth was their leader he says that this latest childlike version kid buu is the original true majin buu and by far the most powerful of them all north and west kai perished against him south kai was absorbed changing the original majin buu into the hulking form that was seen briefly in the previous episode the leader dai kaio was then absorbed by that form but this absorption changed buu into the fat happy buu that came out of the ball this absorption of the kais actually weakened buu making him less focused and less destructive back on earth kid buu creates a powerful ball of energy and throws it at the earth intending to destroy it goku and vegeta deflect it in retaliation kid buu then a creates a ball ten times more powerful than the previous one and throws that knowing that they currently do not have enough strength left to stop it goku and vegeta try to grab everyone and teleport away but are only able to grab dende hercule and bee as the earth is about to be destroyed supreme kai appears and instantly transmits goku vegeta dende hercule and bee to the world of the kais  
buu is blasted apart by the explosion but he reforms after the destruction of the earth and goes on a rampage throughout the galaxy he goes from planet to planet looking for goku and vegeta and then destroys each planet when he doesnt find them he goes to the grand kais planet and starts to toy with everyone there when he becomes bored he creates an energy ball intending to destroy the grand kais planet supreme kai offers goku and vegeta his fusion earrings but they both refuse them they raise their power levels so buu will know where to find them buu abandons his attempt to destroy the grand kais planet and teleports to the world of the kais  
the supreme kai transports himself dende and the elder kai to a distant planet so they will be out of goku and vegetas way along with a crystal ball that allows them to watch the battle unfortunately they forget to take hercule and bee along goku and vegeta play rock paper scissors to decide who will fight first and goku wins he powers up to super saiyan 2 and starts beating up buu he blasts him apart but he reforms buu creates another massive energy ball and throws it down at the planet goku is able to deflect it but buu guides the ball back around and into the planet powerful shockwaves rock the entire planet disfiguring its shape and leaving the surface ragged and uneven goku decides to power up to super saiyan 3  
goku and buu continue to fight each taking powerful blows from each other buu folds himself into a ball again and hits goku hard goku puts all of his energy into a massive kamehameha wave but buu just reforms afterward goku returns to his normal state collapsing from exhaustion vegeta then steps in but finds he is no match for buu buu cleans his clock and just as hes about to deal vegeta the finishing blow goku pushes him out of the way he then powers back up to super saiyan 3 and continues their furious fight vegeta reminisces about all of the fights he and goku were in he finally admits to himself that goku is better  
goku continues to fight buu and he seems to have the upper hand he deals out a lot of damage to buu but as the fight goes on his hits become weaker and weaker until they have virtually no effect at all he tells vegeta that its his turn but vegeta declines citing that he is no match for buu he tells goku that buu is too powerful for him and that goku stands a much better chance of destroying him goku is shocked and unsettled by this admission telling vegeta that he deliberately let the fight drag on so that vegeta could have a turn and now he is exhausted vegeta is horrified by this because now they cannot stop buu goku unsuccessfully attempts to reassure vegeta telling him that he needs one uninterrupted minute to power up enough to destroy buu despite the fact that vegeta recognises that he will need a miracle to survive a minute against buu now he reluctantly steps in while goku is powering up even though goku tells him that if he is destroyed when he is already dead vegeta will no longer exist in any form buu thrashes vegeta but every time he gets knocked down vegeta gets up ready for more buu stretches out his arm wraps it around vegetas neck and begins choking him for fun its been more than one minute but goku hasnt generated the power he needs  
kid buu is about to blast vegeta when suddenly hercule starts to taunt buu buu drops vegeta and turns his attention to hercule the world champ thinking that its all a dream tries to attack buu but is obviously far too weak to do any damage buu is about to destroy hercule but suddenly stops in his tracks clutching his head and screaming while hercule gloats kid buu wrestles with his mind for a while then spits out the fat form of buu who though not part of his physical being was still inside of kid buu shocked and inspired from seeing fat buus still body an enraged hercule tries to beat up kid buu again but fails buu sends a blast toward hercule but it is knocked away by fat buu who has regained consciousness meanwhile goku still cant gather enough energy he starts losing energy and falls to the ground in his normal form  
fat buu is no match for kid buu who begins to severely beat him hercule continues to try to help fat buu but is ineffective vegeta suddenly comes up with a plan he communicates with dende telling him to go to the new planet namek and gather the dragon balls the supreme kai and the elder kai take dende there and the namekians are waiting with the seven balls porunga is summoned and vegeta tells dende his two wishes bring back the earth and restore it to its undamaged state and bring back all of the non-evil people that died since the morning of the world martial arts tournament these wishes are granted and even vegeta himself comes back to life proving that he is no longer evil he finally reveals the main part of his plan to destroy buu the spirit bomb  
the people of earth come back to life including the z fighters and their friends goku gets into position to create the spirit bomb and with the help of king kai vegeta speaks to the entire population of earth he tells them whats going on and that to defeat buu they need to raise their hands up and offer their energy only goku and vegetas family and friends comply no one else is willing to listen to a mysterious voice from the sky vegeta repeatedly pleads with the earthlings but to no avail while this is going on fat buu is buying them time by fighting kid buu but its not going well goku hasnt gathered nearly enough energy to destroy buu  
vegeta continues to plead with the people of earth but no one will listen to him fat buu has finally lost all of his energy so vegeta is forced to fight kid buu he is no match for him and gets severely beaten now goku asks the earthlings to raise up their arms and small pockets of people who recognize his voice or just like the sound of it do so but the vast majority remain uninterested piccolo gohan goten and trunks spread out into the city hoping to convince people to raise their arms hercule has finally had enough and he speaks to the people of earth when they hear the familiar voice of the world champion all of the people of earth raise their arms and offer their energy the spirit bomb is finally ready  
goku is ready to throw the spirit bomb but vegeta is in the way and despite vegetas pleas otherwise he refuses to take out vegeta along with buu suddenly fat buu gets up and holds kid buu down long enough for hercule to pull vegeta to safety kid buu kick fat buu aside and goku throws the spirit bomb it hits kid buu but he starts pushing it back goku uses all of the little energy he has left trying to push it back into kid buu but he is too powerful after a brief panic vegeta suddenly remembers that they still have a third wish with porunga he instructs dende to wish for gokus power level to be restored to its normal healthy level the wish is granted and upon turning into a super saiyan goku is easily able to force the spirit bomb back at majin buu as he does so he silently wishes that buu had been a better person and hopes to fight him some day in the future the spirit bomb hits with full force finally destroying the evil childlike majin buu permanently after billions of years of destruction he has finally been brought to justice  
the supreme kai brings himself dende and the elder kai back to the planet of the kais dende heals vegeta and goku for the final time hercule finds the still body of fat buu and asks dende to heal him so that he wont die vegeta objects and tells hercule to move aside so he can destroy him vegeta says it is too dangerous for any form of majin buu to survive but hercule continues to plead with him goku takes hercules side explaining to vegeta that it was fat buu who saved vegetas life right before goku threw the spirit bomb vegeta reluctantly agrees and the fat majin buu is healed supreme kai takes them all back to dendes lookout where they reunite with friends and family goku tells his family that elder kai gave him his life so he can stay on earth for good as chi-chi breaks down in tears and hugs goku six months later they use their remaining wish with shenron asking him to erase the memory of majin buu from the mind of everyone on earth so that the good buu can assimilate into society life finally returns to normal on earth  
bulma has invited everyone to a barbecue at capsule corporation and gokus family is ready to leave the only problem is that goku is nowhere to be found a frustrated chi chi and the boys leave without him while everyones having a good time at the party goku is out on a mountaintop looking after some eggs that are ready to hatch he protects them from the storm and from predators after they hatch he finally arrives at the party to the delight of everyone  
it is ten years later and much has changed gohan has become a scholar and trunks and goten are in their late teens goku is training with goten when bulma and vegeta who have a new daughter bulla show up after not seeing him in five years goku says that he and goten will be entering the world martial arts tournament so vegeta says that he and trunks will do the same the day of the tournament comes and old friends catch up everyone has arrived to watch gohan who is now married to videl has decided not to enter but his daughter pan will fight since there is no junior division this time she will be fighting with the adults hercule and buu will also be fighting however goku says that there is someone who is 100% human that can threaten to beat him and vegeta

trunks tells the others about cells tournament it will be held in nine days which doesnt give them much time to prepare cell builds the tournament ring and begins to get the word out about the cell games  
as goku and gohan continue to train in the hyperbolic time chamber yamcha and krillin begin to get ready for the cell games cell goes on television and announces his plan to the world he challenges earths best fighters to beat him  
goku and gohan finally emerge from the hyperbolic time chamber and trunks gets them up to speed on whats happening they decide that in the nine remaining days until the cell games piccolo will go in the chamber first followed by vegeta and finally trunks goku decides that he and gohan dont need another period of training in the chamber and will finish their training outside goku confronts cell to size him up  
goku asks korin to weigh his strength against cells and the verdict is that cell is still stronger than goku however goku doesnt seem worried by this at all he seems to have a secret plan meanwhile cell begins to warm up for the tournament by flying into space and destroying some meteors goku sets out he and gohans training regimen which is three days of rest three days of training and then three more days of rest  
as goku continues to relax gohan goes into town and befriends a young girl named lime while there he discovers that the villagers are panicked about cell and have built a shelter mr bourbon the rich man who owns the shelter hired general tao to force the villagers to do what he says gohan is forced to step in and take him on  
chi chi reminisces about the story of how gohan was named goku gohan and krillin relax by picking apples goku remembers an incident involving the tree and a baby gohan later they celebrate gohans birthday  
piccolo emerges from the hyperbolic time chamber as a much more powerful warrior and vegeta takes his place inside to begin his training as cell awaits the start of the games the royal military shows up to try and stop him of course their attempts are futile and cell smites the entire force goku wanting to bring all of these innocent people back to life decides to locate the remaining nameks and ask one of them to become the new guardian of earth  
goku travels to the nameks new planet and dende decides to become the new guardian mr satan announces that he will be fighting against cell in the tournament once dende arrives on earth he creates a new dragon and a new set of dragon balls this new dragon will be able to grant two wishes at a time goku then begins to gather up the seven balls  
with the cell games right around the corner mr satan is busy attending rallies in his own support meanwhile goku is tracking down the last two dragon balls he finds that general tao is in possession of them rather than risk a fight that he knows hell lose tao challenges goku to unlock three puzzle rings to earn his dragon balls finally goku gathers all seven dragon balls and just in time because the cell games are ready to start  
the cell games have finally begun and all of the earths fighters have come to take on the evil tyrant cell mr satan shows up first convinced that he will be the one to take down cell  
mr satans students show up and decide to fight cell first each of them is defeated with virtually no effort from cell mr satan then steps in and is defeated in a more forceful manner with cell pushing mr satan aside into the mountainside finally goku steps into the ring to fight cell  
the fight between cell and goku begins and the earth begins to shake as they fight after they finally land back on the ring it is revealed that it was just their warm-up goku prepares to power up to full strength as the real battle is about to begin  
with goku and cell fully powered up the battle begins and as the match progresses cell realizes that they are very evenly matched and so he resorts to trickery first he uses tiens multi-form trick then he tries piccolos special beam cannon and friezas final attack frustrated he fires an incredibly powerful kamehameha wave luckily goku is able to direct it away from the planet and teleport back to the ring  
the battle between goku and cell continues to heat up both of them seem to have even strength and speed after goku nearly falls out of the ring cell decides to destroy the ring and continue the fight with no rules with nothing restricting them the battle quickly intensifies and as they fight their power seems to increase as they fight on goku decides to attempt to trick cell by preparing a kamehameha wave from up in the air cell doesnt believe that goku would risk destroying the earth and so does nothing to defend himself as the other fighters look on in horror believing that goku will release it from the air goku uses his instant transmission technique and appears directly beneath cell he unleashes the wave directly into cells chest and when the dust clears cell is severely maimed it appears that goku has won the tournament  
as the dust clears cells mangled body becomes visible while the rest of the z fighters believe that theyve won goku thinks differently he senses that something isnt right when he can still feel a large amount of energy in whats left of cells body suddenly cells body stands up to the horror of virtually everybody and regenerates the missing parts cells energy has been depleted by the attack but gokus energy has been depleted more severely and as the battle continues it becomes clear that goku is no match for cell knowing that he cannot win he declares that cell is the winner the z fighters and cell cant believe it  
after gokus shocking declaration cell claims victory over earth but goku says that cell has one more competitor to fight cell has already fought and defeated vegeta trunks and piccolo and these three are supposed to be the strongest of the remaining fighters goku stuns everyone by selecting gohan he claims that gohans strength far exceeds his own despite the rest of the z fighters protests and even despite the fact that goku willingly gives cell one of their senzu beans goku remains confident in gohans strength gohan then powers up and begins his battle with cell  
it appears that cell has delivered the final blow to gohan but gohan is able to recover and he looks more powerful than ever he warns cell that if he is pushed an unbelievable power will be unleashed he tells him about the time raditz came to earth and he was forced to let loose his amazing strength to save goku he also tells cell about the time he had to do the same thing to save krillin from frieza instead of being scared by this cell is intrigued and is determined to push gohan to his limit so he can test himself against this awesome strength  
cell begins to punish gohan in every way he can think of in order to unleash his hidden power he inflicts as much pain as he can on the young saiyan warrior as cell is trying to crush gohan android 16 jumps in and grabs cell he attempts to use the self-destruct explosive inside his chest but finds that he cant krillin reveals that bulma removed it while repairing him cell destroys 16 with one blast and then turns his attention on gohans friends his tail opens up and seven tiny cell juniors pop out one for each of the z fighters  
the cell juniors are attacking the z fighters and theres nothing they can do to defend themselves only trunks and vegeta are able to remotely put up a fight as they continue to beat up on them android 16s head rolls towards the camera crew and makes his final wish he asks mr satan to bring him to gohan running through the crossfire caused by piccolos rapid fire technique he throws 16s head towards gohan once there 16 tells gohan that it is okay to fight if youre doing it for the right reasons and to unleash his power after he utters his final words he is crushed by cell this is enough to push gohan over the edge and to transform into a super saiyan 2  
gohan angered by the destruction of android 16 begins to ascend to a super saiyan 2 cell initially thinks that gohan is making the same mistake that trunks did by simply powering up eventually though gohan fully transforms into a super saiyan 2 to the amazement of the z fighters gohan is fully powered up now to the delight of cell until gohan snatches the bag of senzu beans from cell before he realizes it with the beans in hand he begins to attack the cell juniors one by one he destroys each of the cell juniors each with a single blow trunks comments that he did the transformation right increasing his strength without losing speed when gohan is finished destroying the cell juniors he gives the senzu beans to trunks to distribute to the wounded z fighters and moves on to cell himself  
cell and gohan begin to fight and from the start it is clear that gohan is far superior to cell none of cells punches are landing and gohan doesnt even appear to be trying piccolo comments that the reason goku fought cell first was to show gohan how cell fights cell decides that he should fight at full strength as he powers up the earth itself shakes but even at full power and delivering a quick blow to gohan gohan is able to easily deliver two crushing blows to cell severely damaging cell it appears that gohan has won although piccolo comments that its not over yet  
gohan no matter how many attacks cell throws at him is totally unfazed by cells attacks and it looks more and more like gohan will win the battle desperate cell aims a massive kamehameha wave at the earth hoping to destroy it gohan counters this with an even bigger wave which hits cell and dismembers him gohan starts to reveal the sadistic qualities of the super saiyan 2 preferring to let cell suffer despite gokus protests that gohan must destroy cell now cell regenerates himself and becomes enraged and powers up to an extreme power level but makes the same mistake that trunks did and is unable to hit gohan due to his size gohan then delivers several crushing blows to cell including a kick to his gut which eventually causes cell to regurgitate android 18  
with android 18 no longer a part of cell he regresses to his second imperfect form and finds himself absolutely no match for gohan goku pleads with gohan to end the battle immediately but gohans new found arrogance causes him to simply toy with cell in desperation cell decides to blow himself up along with the planet but goku makes the ultimate sacrifice he transports cell to king kais planet and they are destroyed in the blast goku has managed to save the earth from certain doomat the cost of his own life as the z fighters are mourning the loss of their friend and gohan angered that his arrogance caused him to lose his father cell suddenly reappears and critically wounds trunks with a single blast  
cell is once again in his perfect form after regenerating from his own explosion he reveals that one single cell was left after the explosion and that was enough for him to come back vegeta becomes enraged at the loss of his son and attempts to take on cell on his own he unleashes a barrage of blasts at cell but is eventually tossed aside easily by the even more powerful cell cell aims a blast at vegeta attempting to finish him off but gohan dives in front of him and takes the blast himself gohan survives but is severely injured losing the use of his left arm and whats more krillin has no senzu beans left cell then begins to charge up a kamehameha blast to destroy the earth and proclaims that he will live forever  
cell is through playing games so he decides to take out gohan and the earth once and for all while powering up his kamehameha wave he explains how he became dr geros ultimate perfection gohan thinks this is the end of the world but suddenly goku begins to speak to him telepathically through king kai he tells gohan that he has the strength and that he cannot give up so despite only being able to use one arm gohan powers up the biggest kamehameha wave he can maneuver and aims it directly at cell just as cell releases his wave  
gohan and cells waves collide creating a crater in the earth as gohan struggles to put all of his energy into his wave cells wave begins to overtake his despite the telepathic encouragement of goku seeing that gohan is losing piccolo comes to his aid and attacks cell although the attack is deflected with no effort from cell he continues his efforts tien yamcha and krillin all join in but it is all for nought just as it looks like cell is going to win vegeta fires a giant beam directly at cell and this distraction is just enough for gohan to make the final push and defeat cell the perfect android disintegrates into nothingness thanks to gohans kamehameha wave and the battle was won  
with cell defeated the z fighters head to the lookout to summon the dragon this dragon is able to grant two wishes but unfortunately goku cant be wished back because hes already been brought back in the afterlife although they think of a way to revive him goku suddenly speaks to all of them through king kai he says that all of the trouble that has been caused on earth is because of him frieza the androids and cell were all after him he seems to be a magnet for trouble so he decides to remain in the other world for the earth to be safe without goku now they have one more wish left  
because no one can think of a good wish krillin decides to use it to turn android 18 into a human however shenron says it is beyond his power to do that then krillin wishes to take the explosives out of her which shenron accepts after trunks goes back to his own time life returns to normal for the rest of the z fighters as gohan tells chi-chi that goku will not come back this time and chi-chi begins crying about her loss  
back in his own time trunks decides it is time to end the fight once and for all he finds androids 17 and 18 and easily defeats them later the imperfect cell tries to sneak up on trunks but trunks is too quick for him trunks being much more powerful than cell quickly dispatches him the nightmare is finally over meanwhile goku and king kai begin their journey to the otherworld  


 japan 
goku and king kai arrive in the otherworld king kai explains that the galaxy is divided into four quadrants north south east and west and that each of these quadrants has a kai king kai watches over the north above these four is the grand kai goku and king kai go to the grand kais planet and upon arrival they learn that cell frieza king cold and the four deceased members of the ginyu force are causing trouble in the home for infinite losers goku and pikkon a warrior from the west quadrant are dispatched to deal with it when they get there goku takes care of the ginyu force and pikkon shows off his awesome strength by doing away with the rest of them  
west kai suggests that an otherworld martial arts tournament be held to determine which quadrant has the greatest fighter the grand kai agrees and so the tournament begins after several matches it is gokus turn his opponent grabs him and starts to tickle him into submission goku gets in a hit on him and this causes his opponent to cry and start his metamorphosis into his ultimate form but because this metamorphosis takes 1200 years goku is declared the winner by default  
the quarterfinals of the otherworld tournament are under way in his match goku faces an aquatic being who fills the ring with water underwater goku is no match for him knowing this he flies out of the water and aims a kamehameha wave directly at the ring blowing his opponent out of it goku wins and is a semi-finalist along with tolby from the south and maraiko and pikkon from the west  
the semi-finals in the otherworld tournament begin goku faces off against maraiko of the western quadrant and wins in the meantime pikkon also of the western quadrant defeats tolby from the southern quadrant in the finals goku and pikkon begin to fight after a small skirmish both fighters reveal that they have been hiding their true strength pikkon takes off his weighted training clothes and goku transforms into a super saiyan  
now at full strength the battle between goku and pikkon really heats up the stadium is rocked with their awesome power since they seem evenly matched pikkon reveals his greatest technique the thunder flash attack goku is flattened by this powerful blast twice but when pikkon decides to use it a third time goku finds a weakness he uses instant transmission to appear right behind pikkon and delivers a kamehameha wave that blasts him out of the ring it seems that goku has won but the grand kai reveals that both goku and pikkon touched the ceiling which disqualifies them both as a consolation he offers a private lesson to both of them in a few years  
seven years have passed since the cell games and gokus death and now gohan is a teenager chi-chi decides to send him to high school for the first time in far-off satan city while there he meets hercules daughter videl during the course of the day he tries to hide his true strength but he lets it slip a few times videl suspects that he is the gold fighter who foiled a robbery that very morning but gohan doesnt want her to find out that her suspicions are correct  
gohan asks bulma for help designing a costume for his new persona the great saiyaman he learns that trunks and vegeta have been training vigorously because he can fly with his new costume without revealing his identity he gives the nimbus to his little brother goten whom chi chi was pregnant with during the cell games gohan uses his superhero powers to save a bus of senior citizens from a hijacking  
when gohan thinks a girl at his school angela saw him transforming out of his saiyaman outfit he does everything he possibly can to please her so she wont reveal his identity she asks him out on a date so he obliges hoping to protect his secret a building downtown catches fire so he leaves angela to save the building afterwards when he is looking for her he accidentally runs into videl angela sees them and thinks that gohan is cheating on her with videl as quickly as it started gohans first relationship is over  
videl is obsessed with discovering the real identity of the saiyaman and even suspects gohan when she gets in trouble fighting some terrorists who have kidnapped the mayor of satan city gohan has to go save the day he arrives and easily takes care of most of the gang but finds that videl is strong enough to take them out herself  
a dinosaur friend of gotens is kidnapped and taken to the circus gohan as saiyaman decides to take him back to his parents before they go on a rampage in the city but is stopped by videl who thinks hes stealing the baby dinosaur when the dinosaur parents arrive everyone finds out that saiyaman was right and after a brief skirmish the parents are able to fly away safely with their baby unfortunately for gohan videl found out that he is the great saiyaman she says that she will divulge his secret to the press unless he enters the world martial arts tournament and teaches her to fly  
gohan tells bulma trunks and vegeta that hell be participating in the world martial arts tournament after vegeta says that he too will enter goku suddenly speaks up and says that he will be allowed to come back for one day to compete excited gohan flies off to tell krillin the good news krillin and his wife android 18 each decide to enter as well even piccolo says that hell participate he and goten begin training  
gohan begins training for the world tournament and he takes goten along during the training goten reveals that he can become a super saiyan at nearly half the age gohan didtheir training is interrupted by videl who has arrived to take her first flying lesson he also reveals that trunks is stronger than him  
gohan begins teaching videl and goten how to fly goten quickly manages to manipulate his chi and fly but videl has difficulties she ends up managing to fly as well in the meantime vegeta gets a nasty surprise when his son trunks transforms into a super saiyan during a training session he wondered when the transformation was reduced to a childs play thing he is relieved though to find out that trunks is still a little stronger than goten  
videl finally manages to fly with ease allowing gohan to resume training with goten for the tournament the day soon arrives and most of the z fighters show up to participate including gohan goten piccolo vegeta trunks android 18 and krillin when they arrive at the tournament grounds goku appears and sees his son goten for the first time  
the tournament officials announce that there are only sixteen spots in the tournament and the defending champion hercule is automatically granted a spot so they decide the final fifteen spots with a punching machine although the z fighters try to take it easy their scores still far outstrip the rest of the competition vegeta however does not take it easy and completely obliterates the machine  
just before the junior competition a film is shown depicting hercules triumph over cell only the z fighters and hercule himself know it is a fraud meanwhile trunks runs into a bully in the waiting room and it turns out that his first match is against this kid with two swift kicks trunks effortlessly dispatches this bully  
its gotens turn now and he happens to be fighting the brother of the kid that trunks knocked out goten doesnt seem to understand that the other kids dont have the awesome abilities that he and trunks have and wonders why his opponent wont fight seriously he finally takes this kid out and makes his way to the finals where he faces trunks their battle rocks the stadium and the spectators love it so far its an even match  
the match between goten and trunks begins to heat up trunks gets goten in a stranglehold and goten cannot seem to break free desperate he transforms into a super saiyan and busts loose trunks is angry because all of the saiyan warriors agreed not to transform during the tournament to embarrass him for this trunks decides to fight the rest of the way without using his left arm but when goten seems to have the advantage he uses his left arm and transforms into a super saiyan to knock goten out of the ring trunks says that since both he and goten transformed once theyre even  
as promised hercule begins a match with the junior world champion which happens to be trunks trunks thinks that hercule is as strong as he says he is so he is expecting a real bout hercule in an attempt to trick trunks instructs the boy to give him the lightest punch he can unfortunately for hercule trunks lightest punch knocks the champion out of the ring though luckily it is played off as if he let trunks win while waiting for the adult tournament to begin goku and his friends run into two weird-looking strangers one of whom says he looks forward to fighting goku  
trunks and goten decide to sneak into the adult tournament they knock out a masked fighter and take his costume with goten acting as the legs and trunks as the head it is learned that the names of the two mysterious strangers are shin and kibito the tournament draws are out and in the first round goku will be fighting vegeta but before that krillin videl and piccolo who is fighting under the pseudonym majunior are scheduled to fight their respective matches  
in the first match krillin easily defeats his incredibly large opponent now its piccolos turn to fight the mysterious shin once the match starts piccolo seems to be paralyzed with fear suddenly he realizes who shin is and forfeits the match he tells goku that shin is unimaginably strong videl and the large spopovich fight next  
videls fight with spopovich begins she seems to have the upper hand in this bout but every time she knocks him down he gets back up even when it seems impossible as the fight continues spopovich begins to take the upper hand to counter videl deals him a ferocious kick to the head this kick turns spopovichs head all the way around although it seems like he is dead he suddenly gets back up and straightens his head out meanwhile shin reveals to piccolo that he is the supreme kai he gives him no more details but tells piccolo to keep it a secret  
spopovich starts wailing on videl and theres nothing she can do about it when it seems like he is about to deal out her final blow gohan decides that hes seen too much and goes out to rescue her suddenly yamu spopovichs partner tells him to stop punishing videl and to finish the match spopovich tosses her out of the ring and he and yamu leave for the moment with videl badly injured goku goes to get some senzu beans from korin  
gohan is waiting anxiously for goku to return with the senzu beans finally the hero arrives and gohan takes a bean to videl who heals instantly gohan and kibito start their match but no punches are thrown kibito asks to see gohans super saiyan power and piccolo tells gohan to show him piccolo informs the others that shin is the supreme kai who then informs the z fighters not to intervene if anything happens to gohan gohan begins to power up  
gohan fully powers up and just as shin predicted spopovich and yamu suddenly attack him they stick a weird device inside him steal all of his energy and then leave shin takes off after them and goku piccolo krillin and vegeta follow kibito heals gohan and those two and videl also leave shin explains that long ago there was a wizard named bibidi who created a monster with unbelievable destructive power shin killed bibidi and the monster majin buu was left sealed in a ball now bibidis son babidi has come to resurrect the monster and they plan to use gohans stolen energy to do it

yusuke returns from training with genkai to discover that his home city has been invaded by makai insects inhabiting humans controlled by the makai whistle used by the four saint beasts yusuke and kuwabara enter a hidden portal which takes them to the location of the saint beasts castle kurama and hiei with the offer of pardons from their past crimes have been sent to help yusuke and kuwabara with this new mission once inside the four are faced with holding up a collapsed ceiling trying not to betray one another in order to escape  
hiei finds the switch to raise the ceiling freeing the others from being flattened kurama faces off against genbu the first of the four saint beasts and a master of stone-based abilities using his plant abilities and intuition kurama splits genku apart however genbu is able to reassemble and disassemble as one of his attacks kurama is able to defeat him by identifying his weakness in assembling  
botan figures out that the makai insects can inhabit depressed adults and children kuwabara demands to fight the next opponent himself and encounters byakko the second saint beast byakko summons beasts from within his mane to attack kuwabara nonetheless kuwabara uses his spirit sword to stab through each and every beast with byakkos ability to absorb spirit energy kuwabaras attacks prove fruitless determined to win kuwabara devises a plan to defeat byakko  
byakko is seemingly defeated after absorbing too much spirit energy yet byakko appears once more to fight kuwabara in a room full of molten lava kuwabara is faced with the obstacles of being eaten by byakko and being burned by the lava using a new technique byakko turns the tables on kuwabara who desperately claims victory by sending byakko into the lava  
as the four travel deeper within the castle seiryu the third saint beast appears when byakko weakly arrives and asks for seiryus help in fighting against the quartet seiryu freezes and shatters him to death after declaring him a failure and a disgrace to the four saint beasts hiei chooses to battle seiryu afterward although seiryu seems to have the advantage hiei reveals that he has been merely toying with him and easily reverses all of his ice attacks as seriyu attempts to respond hiei cuts him down with his sword meanwhile the leader of the saint beasts learns about yusukes relationship with keiko and decides to target her with the makai-infested civilians in an attempt to weaken yusukes determination to stop him from carrying out his plan  
botan contacts yusuke and informs him that the makai-infested civilians are searching for keiko in an attempt to kill her as yusuke kuwabara kurama and hiei run towards the watchtower in a desperate manner to defeat the last saint beast and destroy the makai whistle an army of cultivated humans barricade their entrance yusuke jumps into the watchtower to face off against suzaku the last of the saint beasts who controls the makai insects with the makai whistle despite his determination to win yusuke has difficulty in dealing with suzakus lightning abilities  
yusuke tried to snatch the makai whistle from suzaku but to no avail suzaku then reveals his secret technique which is the ability to split himself into seven entities yusuke becomes overwhelmed by the massive attacks suzaku unleashes meanwhile botan and keiko must avoid harm from the makai-infested civilians also kuwabara kurama and hiei are still occupied with the cultivated humans even when entering the watchtower yusuke is reminded of his training under critical condition from genkai committing himself to fight even approaching death  
yusuke uses up almost all of his spirit energy seemingly murdering suzakus entities to which suzaku restores the spirit energies of the six kuwabara kurama and hiei make it to the top of the watchtower yusuke confronted with an image of keiko with her life threatened by the makai-infested civilians finally defeats suzaku by using the last of his life energy to destroy all of his clones as well as to shatter the makai whistle from within the process of his action reverting the makai-infested civilians back to normal while saving keiko and botan at the same time kuwabara transfers some of his spirit energy to the barely surviving yusuke before the four return to the living world  
hiei gives yusuke a cassette sent from koenma that will describe his next case yusuke kuwabara and botan are recruited to rescue the ice maiden yukina from the greedy and cruel human crime lord gonzo tarukane deep within the mountains tarukane forces yukina to cry in order to secrete jewels from the tears of her eyes which are considered to be highly rare and valuable it is revealed that yukina is actually hieis sister in which hiei plans to kill tarukane if he arrives before the others  
yusuke and his friends must fight their way through the human and demon guards surrounding tarukanes stronghold meanwhile tarukane bets on his human and demon guards killing the protagonist group with his fellow members of the black black club a human group of cruel and ruthless crime lords however tarukane loses money every round to fellow black black club member sakyo who bets on the side of the protagonists  
yusuke kuwabara and botan must face off against three specific demons known throughout the spirit world as the triad all three members of the triad are overwhelmed by the protagonists one by one at the same time sakyos successful bets on the protagonists have earned him an enormous amount of money

yusuke urameshi unexpectedly crosses paths with the younger toguro on a street intersection who shows yusuke a demonstration of his true strength in a parking garage yusuke is given an ultimatum in that he must participate in the dark tournament two months ahead organized by human crime lords and drawn in by fierce apparitions or have him and his friends killed left no choice and feeling helpless yusuke and his allies begin a two-month training period soon after yusuke along with kazuma kuwabara kurama hiei and a mysterious masked fighter band together a board a ship leading to the dark tournament grounds  
team urameshi finds out that the preliminary competition is on the ship itself while yusuke sleeps due to exhaustion from training kuwabara kurama hiei and the masked fighter quickly dispose of the attacking competitors qualifying for the next level of the tournament in the process upon arriving at the hotel the five are briefly visited by rinku and zeru two members of team rokuyukai  
koenma as well as botan keiko yukimura and shizuru kuwabara come to witness the dark tournament kuwabara faces off against rinku the first member of team rokuyukai kuwabara is overwhelmed by rinkus acrobatic maneuverability almost being knocked out although kuwabara displays his newfound ability to wield two spirit swords at once he is unable to overcome rinkus assault of yo-yos  
both kuwabara and rinku display the ability to control their spirit energies using their spirit sword and yo-yos respectively they both are pushed outside of the ring yet rinku manages to defeat kuwabara kurama battles roto one who can morph his finger into a sickle who threatens to have his brother kill kuramas human mother however kurama deceives roto by conversing with him until a seed kurama planted in roto at the start of the round blooms killing roto from the inside  
the leader of team rokuyukai zeru challenges hiei who is seemingly overwhelmed by zerus initial fiery assault however hiei uses the jagan eye enabling him to shrug off the assault without a scratch hiei later uses his new technique the dragon of the darkness flame to obliterate zeru the final member of team rokuyukai is chu introduced as a drunkard yusuke finally wakes up from his long slumber to begin his match  
yusuke is annoyed by chus unpredictable movements as he is constantly being pummeled to the ground yusuke shows his ability to use his spirit gun on each of his fingers on his right hand chu then unleashes his special attack resembling much of the power of the spirit gun they are evenly matched as both have exhausted all of their spirit energies  
yusuke and chu agree to have a hand-to-hand combat with one foot pressed against the edge of a knife with the loser receiving death at the hands of the victor keiko cannot stand to see yusuke fight anymore but kuwabara explains that yusuke must fight in order to rematch the younger toguro once more yusuke brutally counters a headbutt executed by chu overcoming him though it was designed to be a death match yusuke spares chus life  
yusuke realizes that he cannot use his spirit gun after encountering a member of the spirit warriors in a forest who is shortly killed by his leader thereafter hiei endures the pain of a paralyzed right arm near the seashore after having used the dangerous technique from before upon returning to the stadium yusuke and kuwabara watches as the younger toguro effortlessly defeats the spirit warriors by himself of which the leader of the team had been acquainted by yusuke earlier in the forest  
yusuke kuwabara and the masked fighter participate in a three-on-three battle with yen ryu and kai of team ichigaki as the members of this team are revealed to be humans they are unwittingly under the control of dr ichigaki after realizing this they essentially refuse to fight and team ichigaki gains the upper hand very quickly meanwhile kurama and hiei has to deal with two other members of team ichigaki who unleash the robot gatasval to attack the two  
the masked fighter saves yusuke and kuwabara from direct attacks by team ichigaki later revealed to be a young woman with pink hair yet her name is still unknown kurama and hiei defeats gatasval mentioning how dr ichigaki took command of yen ryu and kai using the blood-saver node as his invention the three shed tears of blood after kuwabara uses himself as a human shield to bear the combined attack of the three yusuke takes them all on and is able to sense and counter their attacks  
the masked fighter uses the spirit wave technique to remove the blood-saver node from their bodies thereby defeating them dr ichigaki transforms himself into a monstrous creature as a last resort to win the battle however he is quickly bested by an enraged yusuke due to the mechanics of the spirit wave technique it is realized that en ryu and kai are able to regain control of their bodies as they make their way back home team urameshi is forced to battle back-to-back with team mashotsukai a group of shadow channels much to their chagrin  
kuwabara is unable to fight due to the attack by team ichigaki ruka the nurse of the dark tournament is summoned to hold custody of hiei and the masked fighter creating a barrier around them and rendering them unable to escape due to their depleted spirit energy kurama is to face off against gama who uses paint to immobilize his opponent kurama unexpectedly uses his rose whip with his hair to severely wound gama gradually bleeding to death  
kuramas spirit energy is sealed by the dying efforts of gama as his paint was actually mixed with his blood kurama is to battle toya described as an ice master kurama breaks free of paralysis but is denied access to his spirit energy toya attacks kurama multiple times but is unable to target his vital points kurama defeats toya by implanting his plants into his own body to use as a weapon however falling unconscious  
bakken another member of team mashotsukai brutally assaults the comatose kurama nevertheless kuramas life is spared after noticing yusuke preparing to use his spirit gun in retaliation bakken uses his sweat glands to create a fog of mist in the ring attacking a blindsided yusuke it is apparent however that yusuke uses his spirit gun in order to clear the mist making the ring visible yusuke pushes bakken in the stomach for payback of his cruelty utterly damaging his thoracic cage and knocking him out of the ring jin the wind user of team masho then faces off against yusuke displaying the ability of flight  
jin uses his tornado fist to land a hit on yusuke who is literally blown away from the attack yusuke later counterattacks with a series of punches yet jin flies after being hit in the stomach yusuke then uses the spirit gun on him only to see jin create a whirlwind to deflect the blast when jin dives down from the sky using tornado fist a second time yusuke uses spirit gun again to cause a mass explosion however both are surprising still alive both contenders prepare for their ultimate attacks  
while jin has initiated a double tornado fist yusuke begins to use the spirit wave technique after disabling both fist yusuke catapults jin out of the ring overcoming him before yusuke is about to fight with the next opponent of team masho it has been realized that he has been disqualified by a technicality yukina arrives outside the stadium meeting up with botan keiko and shizuru kuwabara though still seriously injured volunteers himself to fight the last battle against risho the leader of the team  
risho easily inflicts further pain upon kuwabara he later unleashes his earth powers initially overwhelming kuwabara who is able to stand up to his feet and every critical hit kuwabara sees yukina in the audience who has arrived to gives him moral support in which he manages to overcome his injuries and defeats risho with his spirit sword  
the spirit beast of yusuke as his ordeal succeeding his death a year ago has hatched resembling that of a penguin now named pu team urameshi catches a glimpse of team toguro in the stadium the masker fighter takes yusuke into the forest to reveal herself to be genkai she begins the final step of training in order to perfect yusukes spirit gun  
yusuke is told that he must take genkais life in order to take her power though this was a test administered to see if yusuke cared about genkais death at all genkai creates a spirit wave orb and fuses it into yusukes body as a test of endurance meanwhile as the semifinal rounds begin the remaining members of team urameshi prepare to face off against team uraotogi in the first match hiei fights the ogreish fighter makintaro slicing off his left arm even when makintaro transforms his arm into an ax hiei effortlessly dispatches him  
yusuke struggles as he bears the pain of the spirit wave orb within him even when genkai attempts to remove it yusuke still chooses to handle the torture hiei is to battle kuro momotaro able to transform with apelike instincts making hieis techniques useless unable to use the dragon of the darkness flame lest it consume him in the process hiei is left with dwindling options  
as kuro momotaro then transforms with birdlike qualities hieis attacks are proven ineffective kuro momotaro later transforms with wolfish capabilities forcing hiei to use his powers in an unorthodox fashion by channeling the dragon of the darkness flame through his sword in order to dispatch kuro momotaro kurama is to fight the unwitting ura urashima as it is the rose whip versus the fishing pole whip in which a telepathic conversation between the two leads to deception of the former kurama is introduced to the idunn box reverting back to his demon form yoko kurama as the ring is covered in fog  
it is explained that kurama had gone into human form fifteen years past recovering his spirit energy from when he was a fox demon while yoko kurama grows a manlike tree having acidic saliva to melt its prey he interrogates ura urashima to discover the secret of the idun box however ura urashima is murdered by shishiwakamaru the leader of team uraotogi before he can reveal any information clearing the fog kuwabara is chosen to fight against shishiwakamaru after a game of rock-paper-scissors much to the dismay of kurama and hiei pu flies to yusuke inside the cave in order to nurture him with water to ease his ongoing pain soon overcame when yusuke smashes a boulder that was headed towards pu  
as kuwabara fights against shishiwakamaru with the spirit sword the latter quickly sends the former through the cape of no return transporting him outside of the ring kuwabara lands in another stadium meeting up with botan keiko shizuru and yukina shishiwakamaru then is to battle the masked fighter as to which genkai is shown now as elderly and not youthful from before the legality of the battle is called into question concerning the occurrence of disqualification after the match has been approved shishi wakamaru unsheathes his banshee shriek sword kuwabara botan keiko shizuru and yukina find yusuke and pu in the forest on their way to the semifinals stadium  
shishiwakamaru twirls his banshee shriek sword to resonance the shrill call of the reaper disturbing the ears of the audience moreover he dissipates the chorus of a thousand skulls from the sword and devours much of the audience kuwabara arrives as shishiwakamaru forms the cage of hell trapping genkai it is then that genkai turns the tables on shishiwakamaru by using her spirit reflection blast against his attack kuwabara must now face off against onji who appears to be just an old man  
keiko is almost attacked by demons in the forest but is saved by the appearance of chu rinku jin and toya they note that yusuke has become stronger onji creates the dimensional travel sphere and sends kuwabara back to the other stadium this elderly fighter then reveals himself to be the clownish suzuki as genkai is elected to fight him suzuki strives to be known as a god after first defeating genkai he whooshes his rainbow cyclone attack on an unharmed genkai who abruptly takes his rubber nose the two engage in hand-to-hand combat as suzuki demonstrates his body of steel muscle explosion technique yet despite this genkai easily defeats him  
three members of team toguro demonstrate their power on another team in the semifinals kuwabara watches over yusuke in the hotel room kurama spectates the fights and hiei goes to the seashore to improve his technique team toguro utterly slaughters this team with minimal effort genkai meets with the younger toguro in the forest mentioning a conflict between them from fifty years ago yusuke wakes up and runs into the forest after sensing the younger toguros immense spirit energy  
it is explained that genkai and the younger toguro were once a pair fifty years back however the younger toguro was greedy for eternal youth and ultimate strength the younger toguro confronts and battles a weakened genkai despite a final effort using her feeble energy genkai is overwhelmed by toguro and becomes mortally wounded as yusuke arrives giving yusuke her dying words she passes away and the younger toguro subsequently launches an enraged yusuke through the forest it is then that yusuke reminisces of when he trained under genkai mourning for her death  
suzuki encounters kuwabara and kurama giving them an elixir and a hilt respectively to enhance their natural abilities koenma finds yusuke in deep depression over genkai sakyo proposes to make a portal between the spirit world and the living world yusuke is motivated to prepare himself for the final round against team toguro  
team urameshi now with ameliorative spirit energies are ready for the final round begins with sakyo and koenma arriving to fill the vacancies on each of their teams the first match begins with kurama facing karasu  
karasus bomb abilities overwhelm kuramas plants just when all seemed grim kurama transforms into yoko kurama due to ingesting the fruit of previous life he received from suzuki before the fight attaining new and improved abilities yoko kuramas demon plants prove too much for karasu to handle  
kurasu loses his mask the only thing inhibiting his full power he unleashes a massive explosion seemingly killing yoko kurama and although he survived however the fruit of previous life reaches its time limit and yoko kurama reverts into his human form giving karasu the advantage in response kurama plays on karasus overconfidence and uses a desperate final attack to secure victory  
despite karasus death kurama loses the fight on a technicality hiei begins to fight bui able to deal with his immense ax attacks with little effort bui is later forced to remove his armor in order to effectively fight hiei  
in response to buis increased abilities hiei uses the dragon of the darkness flame although bui reflects the attacks back to hiei hiei absorbs the flames drastically increasing his physical abilities bui is later defeated in the process hiei goes into hibernation after having drained all his spirit energy  
a long intermission is called for replacing the ring after it was highly damaged kuwabara fights the elder toguro and grows incensed when he is the last to learn of genkais death however the elder toguros regenerative abilities makes kuwabaras attacks useless

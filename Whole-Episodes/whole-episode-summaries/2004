meatwad is playing an atari game called video ouija which allows players to communicate with the dead like a ouija board shake interrupts and takes the controller causing meatwad to get a game over meatwad tattles to frylock who was there the whole time frylock tells meatwad that it is time for bed meatwad begs to play just one more time he communicates with the ghost in the game which talks about its sisters baby meanwhile shake calls frylock into the hallway where hes set up a noose so he can die and get into meatwads game frylock cuts the noose down before he asphyxiates enraging shake who complains that frylock always takes his meatwads side 
later carl knocks on the door to show frylock his pool which is full of blood and piranhas and frylock finds a suicide note from shake a flashback shows that shake breathed exhaust from a hose connected to carls car popped a bottle of sleeping pills and jumped in the pool which he packed full of piranhas and connected to several car batteries apparently not wanting to take any chances that his suicide would be unsuccessful carl is only upset that he cannot press charges and threatens frylock when frylock leaves without cleaning up the mess 
meatwad has gotten bored with video ouija and has moved onto a new game insult master frylock tries to get meatwad to play video ouija again but meatwad has had enough of the ghost talking about its sisters baby frylock breaks the news to meatwad about shakes death but meatwad is unaffected so frylock plays the game himself to communicate with shake shake wants out of the game because hes annoyed by the ghost baby who will not stop crying he asks frylock to bring him back to life

frylock decides to shrink himself so that he can go inside of meatwad to retrieve the chip master shake has other plans as he shrinks frylock and forces him into battle with a shrunken carl frylock does not want to fight but shake has promised carl to make his johnson bigger if he wins master shake shrinks frylock even more to the point where he disappears leaving carl to face a shrunken meatwad eventually the three all shrunken very small end up inside master shakes head and discover he has no brain they manipulate shake through his nerve endings forcing him to beat himself with a bat and cut out his tongue with a chainsaw 
with shake out of commission frylock manages to push the button on it to enlarge meatwad who falls asleep instead of enlarging frylock and carl this leaves frylock and carl no choice but to destroy shakes eye to get out of his head all of the shrunken and enlarged items suddenly go back to normal including the computer chip that is still inside meatwad frylock destroys the shrink ray but not before carl enlarges his penis to immense size as well as his crab lice 
 
the mooninites come across a gigantic check which they believe to be a government stipend for a crazy relative of ignignokts named cliff who gets crushed by a rock as they leave it is several times bigger than they are and is covered in what appears to be some sort of squarish writing the mooninites travel to earth to cash the check 
back on earth master shake attempts to microwave meatwad with some tinfoil however frylock discovered shakes crudly drawn plans and has reversed the rays in the microwave earlier causing the kitchen to melt at that time the mooninites break in coerce master shake and meatwad to help them cash the check although frylock suggests that they go to a check-cashing place the mooninites refuse to follow an earthlings suggestions and instead head to a convenience store there the store clerk tells them that he does not cash checks despite the mooninites attempt to lay into him 
the mooninites decide they need someone with identification to cash the check when they cannot work out a proper deal with carl they knock him out shave off the hair on the back of his head and mustache and have meatwad disguise as carl when that fails meatwad decides to take from the take a penny leave a penny tray and buy gum meatwad then tells ignignokt of everything else at the store prompting err to rob it 
when they return home frylock scans the check and it turns out that what they thought was a check is in fact actually a radioactive bill the radiation causing shakes hands to turn long and pale when the mooninites try to microwave their stolen food it does not work due to the rays being reversed prompting the aqua teens to evacuate the house before it explodes afterwards carl wakes up to his hair and stache being gone frylock tells him that it makes him look younger though carl believes that it makes him look gay 
 
frylock learns that people have been seeing the face of jesus on a billboard however he cant actually say jesus because of standards and practices he shows meatwad a video explaining the process which helps keep funny ideas away from tv viewers the movie itself has george lowe as the narrator who demonstrates standards and practices by blowing a nuns head of with a shotgun whereas a fountain of blood spurting from her neck is unacceptable a rainbow emerging from her neck is thereafter the character is referred to as gee whiz who frylock describes as looking like ted nugent every time someone curses or says black in this episode a red x appears on the screen and a various sound effect is played instead of the usual beep 
the aqua teens decide to check out the billboard meatwad prays for a meat cravers pizza with a thick crust and mild sauce and leaves money to pay for it after they leave master shake comes out of hiding and tries to steal the money but he is thwarted by flaming arrows from above back home frylock tries to explain to meatwad the story of jesus but quickly finds out that a genetic impossibility has happened - meatwad has become pregnant

ted nugent approaches the aqua teens and reveals that it was his image that was seen on the billboard he then shoots carl who states that he is a huge fan with a flaming arrow mistaking him for a varmint after several warnings not to move carl sets off a bomb in the arrow blowing off the upper half of his body and a rainbow rises out of his body frylock and shake are thankful because they would have been muthafucking offended if he bled 
frylock and shake cuss some more and its censored in the same manner the standards &amp practices guy says acceptable and a checkmark appears over the screen ending the episode 
master shake purchases and dons numerous robotic enhancements to allow him to connect ever more technologically to the world at large carl joins him but ultimately the enhancements perform in ways neither expected and are very heavy rendering both shake and carl unable to walk though they order a pair of legs and robotic heads to help them move around the legs cause carl to unwittingly bang shake while the heads eventually walk them to carls pool where both are electrocuted and explode 
 
master shake and frylock get jobs at the food court processing meat into drinks when they come home carl who was apparently supposed to babysit meatwad tells them that he let meatwad get into the medicine cabinet meatwad appears in the kitchen as a sunflower saying that the pills are jelly beans the next day frylock unveils robositter a robot which appears to be made of random metal trash from around the house 
after they leave robositter who has a teenage girls voice despite her appearance demands the phone meatwad gives her a toy phone saying that you can call candyland but you need a calling card made of candy robositter says that shell tear his soul apart and then throws him at the wall while meatwad is crying robositter calls her friend sheila when meatwad approaches her again she ends up chasing him down the street with a whirring spike at the end of her arm 
the scene shifts to the mall where shake quits his job leaving frylock to do it alone then robositter comes by with her robot friend sheila who she made robositter is wearing makeup a thong and a halter top they demand money from frylock to get tramp stamps robositter insults frylock and he lures the robots to look into a liquifying machine which he turns on meanwhile meatwad has burned down carls house 
 
meatwad has another new rap album and as with the other two hes playing it loud enough for the whole house to hear his album is from a new hip-hop artist an old man named little brittle - who frylock assumes is mc pee pants the creature from whom meatwad bought the other two albums the first under his real name the second under sir loin after not being able to convince meatwad that it really is mc pee pants he decides that they should go to 612 wharf avenue where they had gone before to meet the rapper however meatwad informs him that little brittle is at tragic castles retirement home and they should go there to visit him shake wants to come but only if they make a side trip to peru after he is refused he tells frylock that dracula called and hes coming tonight an insult he used in several episodes 
naturally since hes a doddering old man in his latest satan-punishment persona little brittle doesnt remember what happened in the past despite frylock showing him pictures of what happened before with them little brittle doesnt remember anything of what happened even treating meatwad like his grandson frylock then leaves meatwad with little brittle despite the fact that he smells like lotion and doo-doo 
after leaving meatwad returns home to find frylock and shake arguing over cupcakes frylock tries to get meatwad to bring little brittle some cupcakes but meatwad says little brittle wont eat them because the government made them too hard to chew on purpose 
meatwad then tries to turn little brittle into a vampire by biting him with his one tooth frylock sees whats going on and finally little brittle/mc pee pants reveals why hes come backbecause he wants to be bitten by a vampire and live forever he released the cd in transylvania so vampires could listen to it and come help him out he doesnt want to go back to hell and find out what satan has planned for him next after turning him into a cow and a worm in super sir loin and the last one respectively frylock tries to convince him that he wont ever be bitten by a vampirebut a vampire comes into the retirement home and grants little brittle his wish saying that he was so cool and that he loved his record 
little brittle then comes outside to show off his new look apparently unaware that vampires cannot be exposed to direct sunlight he quickly explodes and ends up back in hell as a bat which satan doesnt care for 
meatwad finds a new video game under his pillow called moon master which is a deceptively easy game the mooninites placed to recruit people to fight a character called the gorgotron the mooninites convince meatwad to go along with a pyramid scheme which involves selling poor-quality moon master merchandise master shake too falls prey to the mooninites scheme and he meatwad and carl try to get frylock to buy stuff from the catalog

meatwad is power walking to lose weight so he can wear his roller skates again carl shows up and makes a bet with frylock that he can lose more weight than meatwad thanks to his south bronx paradise diet the loser buys the winner a case of carls favourite beer master shake tries to get in on the bet but instead ends up trying to make meatwad lose the competition frylock inadvertently kills shake by extracting his contents with his vacuum cleaner on shakes request 
over the course of the episode carl gets so thin that in the last few minutes of the episode his pants fall down of which no one not even carl notices frylock starts to question the diet bars he examines them with his microscope and discovers they are filled with parasitic larvae frylock realizes that the name of the diet is actually south bronx parasite a large larva then bursts out of carls body lays carls mutilated body on the scale and excitedly cheers i won in your face frylock the aqua teens flee the house in terror 
 
while at a museum the aqua teens come across a t-shirt that was alleged to give osiris the egyptian god of the dead his powers master shake who didnt want to even be there in the first place suddenly finds an interest in the shirt and decides to steal it telling meatwad to take the form of a hammer shake swoops in smashes the glass case the shirt is in with a crowbar and steals the shirt leaving meatwad to be corralled by museum security 
back at the aqua teens house shake tries to use the shirt but cant because a he apparently doesnt know how and b it needs a washing because apparently after over 5000000 years it smells like ass according to frylock 
the shirt finds its way into the aqua teens washing machine along with meatwads christmas sock shake is very angry upon hearing this and tells meatwad that it needed to be in there with a full bottle of bleach and washed in very hot water although frylock who apparently can read hieroglyphics says its cold water only the laundry comes out of the washer with meatwads christmas sock faded and shakes t-shirt shrunk considerably so much so that only meatwad can wear it shake then gives the shirt to meatwad and tells him to do his bidding frylock heads off to the mall 
the first thing shake wants is a plague of snakes however meatwads signals get crossed and he ends up calling the easter bunny instead another try nets the easter bunnys twin brother darryl on the next try meatwad brings in santa claus who first scolds shake for being a naughty boy to which shake replies by saying dont play with me fat man then scolds meatwad for calling him in the middle of july when he was asleep telling him that the elves dont come in to him until september after meatwad tells him what he wants for christmas santa tells him that it doesnt work the way he thinks it does meatwad then decides to make one of his presents a unicorn with a banana seat and a horn appear although he cant seem to get the horn right 
next door in carls yard another of meatwads creations eggzilla a giant fire-breathing easter egg is wreaking havoc santa goes outside to see what happened and is set ablaze by eggzilla carl comes next door to complain to meatwad about it then promptly gets his house crushed by eggzilla and his girlfriend frustrated carl starts to take a crowbar to his car 
frylock returns home to see what happened and hooks a badly burned santa up to a life support system after putting him out and dragging him inside the house santa vows that if he makes it out alive hes going to beat the *bleep* out of meatwad frylock tries to reason with santa telling him that meatwad just got a little carried away with the t-shirts power however santas not persuaded and says meatwad got a lot carried away then claiming that meatwad will get the remote-control racecar he wanted far up his ass frylock tries to reason with santa as he says he might see if the reindeer like meat this year santa then attempts to get up to go after meatwad but frylock pushes him back onto the ground telling him he needs to rest santa then remembers frylock is meatwads roommate and asks him who will deliver the toys for him if he dies to which frylock answers that he doesnt know santa assumes that frylock doesnt know how santas job works and asks if he can borrow frylocks phone so he can call the police santa then asks frylock to bring him a mirror so he can see how his face looks frylock seems reluctant and santa assumes he looks like a monster which frylock tries to say that he doesnt santa sarcastically comments on how mrs claus will want to see him under the mistletoe looking the way that he is while frylock tries to tell him he will be fine once his beard and eyebrows grow back santa then proclaims himself horror claus and lays back down saying oh god after a while santa says that the rooms getting cold which frylock says means hes going into shock which santa immediately denies frylock calls meatwad into the room and santa joins him saying take a look at what youve done to me meatwad comes in wearing a banana suit and is shocked by what he sees he tries to fool frylock by making up a story that santa was a burglar and was lit on fire by bad wiring but frylock easily sees through meatwads lie the easter bunny suggests giving santa a chocolate easter bunny and frylock shoots off the bunnys face in response

roz hates her new job at kpxy so much that she abandons it after one day she walks back into kacl and disposes of frasier’s new wheelchair-bound producer after recovering from the initial shock of seeing roz back frasier demands to know her reasons for returning but without success he consults niles firmly convinced that roz has feelings for him and is also concerned because he frasier and julia are on the verge of taking their relationship to the next level niles however is having problems of his own he and daphne have decided to try for a baby when it is revealed that niles once made a contribution to a sperm bank during college with daphne worried that niles may already have a child niles goes to the sperm bank to make enquiries only to be told that his sample was discarded due to low motility niles then starts taking all measures in order to improve motility he eventually decides to tell daphne and the two anticipate a difficult time conceiving but in the end the worrying was for nothing as it turns out that daphne is already pregnant 
daphne is pregnant and she and niles are keen to make an official announcement to the family over dinner rather than tell frasier informally and have the news broadcast for them meanwhile frasier’s relationship with julia has run into difficulty and following a conversation with his brother frasier decides to “commit to commitment” and resolve the problems rather than run away from them his reconciliation with julia ends up coinciding with niles and daphne’s announcement dinner which they are compelled to relocate to frasier’s place after their oven breaks down they agree to let julia stay for dinner and even though they find her frankness and general conduct offensive frasier is reluctant to find fault because of his renewed commitment eventually julia mocks frasiers hand towels and he breaks up with her in disgust in the end frasier apologises for allowing julia to ruin the evening and the family celebrate niles and daphnes happy news 
frasier thinks that rozs new boyfriend is gay he follows him into a gay bar which makes everyone think that frasier is gay alistair burke a high-profile gay opera director patrick stewart then becomes interested in frasier who may be too enamoured with the perks of a power-couple relationship to set alistair straight 
while out shopping for a couch frasier and niles encounter ronee lawrence wendie malick a former babysitter from years ago who turned down frasier’s affections and used to tell niles scary bedtime stories they learn that she is now working as a singer and pianist at a local hotel having established also that she is divorced frasier takes the opportunity of inviting her round to his house for cocktails that evening martin is delighted to see ronee and soon both he and frasier are flirting with her they both pursue her to the wellington hotel to see her play and continue competing for her attention frasier persuades her to duet with him but is disappointed when she sings directly to martin – and his mood is reflected in his playing as ronee and martin grow closer frasier goes through a spell of depression and since he is due to start private psychiatry again soon niles becomes worried 
frasier seems to have become a lonely bachelor who spends his evenings eating vegetable soup and looking after a friend’s cat mr bottomsley dining out with the family is also now an embarrassment for him being between two couples niles and daphne and martin and ronee roz offers to set him up with a friend of hers a divorcée who works in insurance saying she would be the perfect “placeholder” frasier is not keen but desperate not to turn into a solitary old man agrees to a date with ann played by julia sweeney halfway through what he finds an insufferably dull meal kenny appears with his attractive cousin liz wright krista allen who works in the arts and offers frasier a way out all he has to do is get rid of his date 
martin’s relationship with ronee seems to be going well although frasier does not appreciate being woken up in the morning by ronee’s musical stylings then quite accidentally frasier overhears ronee arranging a date with another man in a phonecall he is at first not sure whether to tell martin or not but in the end is unable to stop himself martin’s reaction is to chastise him for eavesdropping despite his protestations that it was accidental later when martin asks ronee to go with him to a doo-wop concert and she claims to have made plans he elicits the truth from her and she tells him she was not under the impression their relationship was exclusive this leads martin to pretend he also has another woman called sheila a rôle that roz finds herself cast in before long frasier overhears this conversation too and suddenly finds this happening to him rather frequently 
frasier makes a return to practicing private psychiatry and although he is most excited his first day turns into a sequence of disasters niles who is doing his best to cope with a pregnant and hormonal daphne receives an unexpected phonecall from a hysterical maris he agrees to meet her for lunch and learns that she has problems with a new boyfriend an argentine polo player who has a violent temper niles advises maris to leave him and is worried how daphne will react to hearing about the meeting both frasier and martin advise him to keep it to himself so when daphne starts asking questions about lunch niles pretends to be organizing a surprise baby shower for her however the deception becomes progressively more difficult to sustain 
maris has been arrested for the murder of her argentine boyfriend and the police have called in niles for questioning it soon becomes apparent that the murder weapon was an antique crossbow belonging to niles which he had lent to maris for an artistic re-enactment even though niles emerges unscathed from the police interview he and daphne have to endure several days of persecution by the press and sleep deprivation not to mention endless phonecalls from maris in prison the situation becomes worse when frasier offers to make a television statement on niles’ behalf and once on camera makes a horrendous malapropism mistakenly saying his brother should be “executed” meaning to say “exonerated” all this time niles is dealing very calmly with the whole situation – almost too calmly in fact and frasier knows the dangers of repression things finally break down in café nervosa when niles suffers a nervous breakdown he undresses and ends up sitting at a table completely naked reading a newspaper roz defends niles keeping everyone in the restaurant from calling the police while frasier is able to get him to safety 
lilith is in town for a psychiatric conference and frasier reluctantly assumes his obligation to meet with her before he does so an interested colleague of liliths sets him up on a blind date with her not knowing who he really is meanwhile martins pistol accidentally discharges inside the apartment creating a trail of destruction that he daphne and niles try to hide from frasier 
since maris murder case appeared in the news niles has acquired a certain celebrity status in seattle socialising with figures like bill gates frasier cannot help being annoyed by this and he finds roz in a similar position she is receiving a visit from her perfect married sister denise frasier hopes to regain some notoriety when he is nominated twice for the seattle broadcasting awards the seabees and kenny arranges for a news reporter to shadow him on the day of the ceremony unusually it takes place in the morning and in the absence of a date frasier asks denise to take the part just for presentation niles is also in attendance and the reporter is keen to ask him questions – although this turns out to be the least of frasiers problems 
it is christmas frasier has been asked to act in a commercial for the seattle tourist board and is more than a little interested in natalie who is arranging it he meets her in café nervosa but she also meets martin and eddie and seeing how cute eddie is decides that he should be in the video as well – much to frasiers chagrin he hopes the arrival of his son frederick will cheer him up but when he sees he is now a goth complete with new goth girlfriend andi and wants to spend all his time with her frasier is left a little shocked and somewhat downhearted niles sees fredericks goth choice as a phase and typical of a teenage rebellion prompting a discussion of what everyone did to rebel as a teenager with martin pointing out that niles had never rebelled even though in season 1 it is stated he was arrested for mooning president nixon this leads niles to take some drastic action he is going to get high on reefer frasier questions where he is going to get hold of some – answered when roz delivers niles a pot brownie niles car alarm goes off at that point and neither frasier or roz can stay so roz gives the brownies to martin who is just arriving in the café he tries to stop himself eating them as he is trying to cut down on junk food but cant help himself of course he does not know they are laced with cannabis but having eaten it buys a normal one to make sure niles doesnt know he has eaten the one destined for him niles therefore is none the wiser and eats his normal brownie still under the impression he will get high while frasier cannot believe his eyes when he finally sees the advert for the seattle tourist board – they have made eddie the star with frasier narrating what eddie is saying undaunted he leaves to go out on a date with natalie after niles arrives high on his pot brownie martin arrives soon after and niles believes that the crazy way his father begins acting is just the pot kicking in it takes a sober frasier to point out that its their father that is high claiming to martin youre stoned off your ass which leaves niles somewhat deflated until his brother points out that he did get their cop father high meanwhile frasier is a bit depressed as his date natalie left him midway through the date to meet another man freddie also experiences the same thing and the similarity in incidents help father and son to bond again 
the kacl team has a weight loss competition with a competing radio station the whole team pigs out just before the first weigh-in just in order to bloat the original numbers frasier however refuses to participate in such an act of “blatant unsportsmanship” in the episode’s sub-plot a pigeon flies into frasier’s glass window niles and martin take it upon themselves to nurse it back to health at the initial weigh-in frasier recognizes one of his “mortal enemies” from his high school days participating on the opposing team the two make a bet on the outcome of the winner with frasier’s dignity pitted up against a new chess set the kacl team undergoes increasingly extreme measures to lose weight including a complete fast 24 hours before the final weigh-in furthermore frasier has converted his bathroom into a steam room and invites the entire kacl team to use it to shed some more weight before the final weigh-in in conclusion of the sub-plot eddie takes the pigeon out of the box and eats it unbeknown to frasier shortly afterwards kenny daly says he needs to get a glass of water from the kitchen suspicious of his intentions the kacl team suggest frasier monitor that he doesnt eat anything he then finds kenny eating something and feathers all round the pigeons box frasiers shocked cries bring the others martin then reveals it was eddie who ate the pigeonthis news makes everyone lose their appetites for the final few hours of the competition but at the final weigh-in the kacl team loses by a mere 2 ounces so roz cuts off her hair and kacl wins the competition 
martin discovers an envelope in the pocket of one of his jackets which contains a cheque for frasier’s home insurance renewal and should have been posted months previously realising this frasier makes a hasty call to the company and is horrified at the amount he would have to pay now to renew roz advises him to consult ann hodges whom frasier remembers from their disastrous date the placeholder he reluctantly agrees and invites her round to survey his home where she slips on a mayonnaise spillage in the kitchen and breaks her leg anxious to avoid a lawsuit when he has no insurance frasier decides to invite ann to stay at his place for a few days while she recovers – a decision he soon regrets meanwhile maris has been released on bail and is being kept under house arrest with an electronic tracking device on her wrist niles learns that she plans on auctioning some possessions to help pay legal costs she offers him the chance to look over them first so he seizes the opportunity to reclaim a “quasi-erotic” portrait of himself as pan little does he realise that he is about to act as a decoy in her escape plan 
frasier’s radio show is receiving very few calls and niles has been losing patients and arguing with daphne martin on the other hand is offered the chance to spend the weekend at a house in the mountains with ronee courtesy of her boss they inadvertently end up inviting frasier niles and daphne to join them and seeing the state those three are in martin and ronee feel compelled not to let them down they all go to the house determined to have a relaxing time but once there frasier has a nightmare in which he has murdered niles and is married to daphne soon afterwards niles has a nightmare about the stresses of being a father and then daphne also has one in which she puts on copious weight after childbirth and niles sleeps with other women the three of them all end up in the kitchen in the middle of the night arguing and it falls to martin to sort them out

frasier is becoming fed up with his father playing tricks on him and mocking the effeminate scream that his pranks provoke it happens that frasier is treating a patient who has the rare condition of coulrophobia – fear of clowns part of the treatment he has planned is to dress up as a clown so he has a very comprehensive costume in a bid for vengeance on his father frasier disguises himself as a clown which martin hates after frasier jumps out at him wearing the outfit martin has a heart attack and is hospitalized this spurs martin to propose to ronee while recovering 
frasier is pacing up and down his apartment while a storm goes on outside niles arrives annoyed at being called away from the “gifted infants’ toy expo” and frasier confesses that he has committed a crime punishable by us law there then follows a flashback while he explains frasier has been having a bad day during his radio show he came down with a coughing fit and roz had to advise his kleptomaniac caller babette after which she claimed he had been dispensing the same advice for ten years he was later turned down by an attractive woman who had parked her car in his space and cornered at his front door by an elderly neighbour who said she could set her watch by his routine he also did not appreciate coming home to two happy couples – niles and daphne and martin and ronee – while he himself is still single calling round to change a light bulb for his neighbour he learned that even she is still dating at the age of 83 at this point in the story niles learns of frasier’s crime he surreptitiously stole an item from one of her shelves just for the thrill however now he is plagued by guilt and wants niles’ help in returning the item in case he feels the urge to steal again neither of them realises the importance of the stolen object 
frasier stumbles upon a matchmaking service on the way to his office and takes some time explaining to the woman at the door that he is there by mistake however this is followed by an encounter with a former girlfriend in the elevator and since charlotte the matchmaking agent played by laura linney witnesses this frasier decides to come quietly after parting with 10 000 he is sent on a series of disastrous dates and eventually loses patience and demands his money back it is then that he discovers the business and its agent are not what they seem niles and daphne have been socialising with another couple expecting a child brad and cindy this couple talk at length about all their plans for the birth what to do with the placenta and so forth and brad even seems to be experiencing a sympathetic pregnancy determined not to be outdone niles and daphne decide to hire a doula for their birth 
martin is soon to meet ronee’s mother again and given that she is opposed to pre-marital sex they have to pretend that they are not practising it frasier is distracted constantly by thoughts of charlotte the matchmaking agent with whom he had dinner the other night and who is already in a relationship niles agrees with him that his feelings could be transference but after seeing frasier when he talks to charlotte roz dismisses that theory instantly she decides to help frasier out by taking him to a bar where he meets a flirtatious woman called kim they both go back to his place but receive several interruptions the last of which is by charlotte who has just had an argument with her boyfriend and wished to be consoled by frasier meanwhile niles has developed an uncharacteristic taste for fast food and it is driving daphne to distraction 
frasier plans to work his charms on charlotte to tempt her away from frank aaron eckhart so he invites her for what she assumes to be a working dinner at a high-quality restaurant for him frank also turns up this becomes the first of several occasions on which frasier ends up spending time with charlotte and frank and at no point does frank suspect that his intentions are less than honourable on the contrary he thinks of frasier as a real friend there is however tension between him and charlotte and matters come to a head one evening when frasier has cooked dinner for charlotte and frank turns up unannounced the couple have an argument and frank walks out leaving frasier with just the opportunity he was hoping for martin plans to give ronee her engagement ring but when daphne and roz discover that it is the same ring he planned to give to sherry they insist that he sell it and buy one especially for ronee this he does and the new ring is very impressive but its origins are somewhat unexpected 
having spent the night with charlotte frasier is very pleased with himself however his good mood disappears when while driving her to the station to catch a train to portland she tells him that in three weeks she will be moving back home to chicago neither wants a long-distance relationship so they are compelled to consider breaking up before things get more serious in the midst of this conversation they miss the train so frasier drives to the next station owing to his over-careful driving they miss it again and then the car breaks down on the way to the next station leaving them stranded in the middle of nowhere fortunately they find the house of an experienced car mechanic and his family but they turn out to be rather eccentric meanwhile in frasier’s absence niles is left to organize the entertainment for martin’s bachelor party and roz has found him a stripper for niles that she is coming round to be interviewed on the same day as daphne’s new nanny while the stripper is mistaken for martin’s new physiotherapist

with the barrier destroyed inuyasha and bankotsu continue their battle clashing each other with lightning attacks the alter ornament saint hakushin is mystically summoned and has purified the tetsusaiga a barrier is formed around bankotsu transporting him to a hidden temple inuyasha and his companions make their way head towards mount hakurei however the power of the barrier erected by the spirit of saint hakushin cannot be broken nor crossed by any demon so miroku and sango enter the barrier to find naraku while inuyasha kagome shippo and kirara stay behind  
koga is attacked by renkotsu and ginkotsu from afar sango and miroku are to scout mount hakurei from within its barrier however miroku struggles to retain his lechery for sango renkotsu and ginkotsu are lured out of the barrier after bombarding koga with cannon blasts and flamethrowers which gives koga the upper hand renkotsu is bruised by koga who attempts to remove the shard of the shikon jewel from his throat ginkotsu destructs the area sending his shard of the shikon jewel to renkotsu inuyasha senses an explosion initiated by ginkotsu as he is led to koga whose legs are badly wounded

sesshomaru is beguiled into the barrier of the mountain being forced to combat against jakotsu sesshomaru then manages to pierce his hand his sword into jakotsu and suikotsu respectively however the two remain alive due to the tainted shards of the shikon jewels in each of their throats kikyo arrives and interrupts the battle implanting a sacred arrow in suikotsu hence purifying his shard of the shikon jewel suikotsu finally free of his evil persona reveals the origins of his conflicting personalities he explains that his bad persona arose as he first killed someone with his own hands jakotsu takes suikotsus shard of the shikon jewel after kikyo was requested to do so  
renkotsu vows to avenge ginkotsu’s destruction after recovering from kogas battle preparing his artillery for an assault inuyasha is mentioned to have carried koga to a cave near a waterfall to recover much to his dismay renkotsu distracts inuyasha with the saimyōshō while he ignites the waterfall into flames later sending him attacks of ammunition after entering the cave renkotsu threatens to light incendiary devices to obtain kogas shards of the shikon jewel however inuyasha sends renkotsu into the river of flames causing a huge eruption luckily both of them manage to survive much to a surprise  
as they have reached the summit of mount hakurei miroku and sango are attacked by kagura in a shaft after kagura defeats sango by using the wind gust against her hiraikotsu miroku uses wind tunnel to vacuum the demons even enduring the poison of the saimyōshō meanwhile jakotsu gives suikotsus shard of the shikon jewel to bankotsu who happily thanks him inuyasha decides to enter the barrier in order to find miroku and sango but finds himself in trouble when confronted by renkotsu inuyasha is purified by the barrier reverting himself to human form while miroku and sango are also both purified by the barrier being able to escape outside the mountain  
although inuyasha manages to avoid renkotsu he now faces off against jakotsu miroku and sango discover a hidden temple being shrouded in the mists of mount hakurei which lead them directly to saint hakushin who continues to uphold the barrier despite his knowledge of the true nature of naraku saint hakushin explains that he fell ill during a time of famine in his village swearing to protect the village after his death the pair must destroy saint hakushin and his formidable barrier in hopes for inuyasha to regain his demonic powers  
inuyasha easily defeats jakotsu with his tetsusaiga having his demonic powers restored renkotsu removes the shard of the shikon jewel from jakotsus throat meanwhile kikyo questions saint hakushin about his desires after being reborn through naraku elsewhere bankotsu is aware of renkotsus motives as the former takes two shards of the shikon jewel from the throat of latter the two duel to the death trying to prove who has more power upon defeating him bankotsu removes the last shard of the shikon jewel from renkotsus throat as payment for his betrayal kikyo empathizes with saint hakushin as he dissolves the barrier and she brings solace to his spirit  
bankotsu sets his sight on inuyasha using all seven shards of the shikon jewel bankotsu explains how he the band of seven was joined after he first met naraku who mentions about the manifestation of the shikon jewel bankotsu recalls the moment that he was resurrected by naraku with a shard of the shikon jewel miroku and sango return to the shaft as they are met by kagura once again it is discovered that naraku used saint hakushin to reside within the barrier of mount hakurei in order to complete his demonic transformation all due to the fact that inuyasha has acquired the barrier shattering kagome locates where naraku and bankotsu are inside the mountain  
inuyasha is able to take out almost all of the shards of the shikon jewel from bankotsus body inuyasha describes bankotsu as a human shield for naraku to which he objects inuyasha notices a shard of the shikon jewel embedded in bankotsus banryu when it evolves after slashing through one thousand demons the fight finally reaches its conclusion when inuyasha uses the backlash wave mount hakurei becomes animated becoming like quicksand within the caves where koga becomes devoured kagome shippo and kirara struggle as they reunite with miroku and sango inuyasha is seen entangled in an intestinal structure as he ascends toward narakus whereabouts  
naraku is reborn from mount hakurei in which the mountain is part of himself he collects and merges all the shards of the shikon jewel revealing his completed demonic transformation inuyasha attempts to attack naraku with the wind scar only to have that attack absorbed and reflected in various parts of the cave kikyo witnesses kagura from the mountain with an unusual bundle kagome senses kogas presence within narakus demonic aura dispersing the wind scar and releasing koga from the demonic aura naraku begins to destroy the mountain putting the lives of inuyasha and his companions in danger  
while inuyasha goes down into the depths of the mountain to retrieve koga the rest of the group struggle to escape the collapsing mount hakurei meanwhile naraku comes after kikyo who questions his purpose naraku says that he lured her to the mountain he now is longer held back by the human heart of onigumo now in the possession of kagura kikyo is now defeated and is thrown into the crevices of the cliff sesshomaru enters to attack naraku in which it is absorbed and reflected back after naraku takes his leave inuyasha learns from sesshomaru that kikyo has died  
inuyasha desperately searches for kikyos remains but has no luck in the matter inuyasha and his companions revisit shintaros village where it is later ravaged by a swarm of demons they are met by an elderly priest who tells about kikyo being washed up at the end of a riverbank two days prior on the other side of the mountain inuyasha goes in that direction in hopes of finding her when a group of soldiers captures kagome along with miroku and sango she finds out that she has been tricked by kagura while miroku and sango are surrounded by the soldiers kagome becomes ensnared by the darkness in her heart as the infant the seventh incarnation of naraku whom kagura took from the mountain takes control of her

the team realizes they are in another genjutsu in order to draw out the assailants naruto disguises several of his shadow clones as his teammates and fights the enemy clones all night when the rain genin believe that team 7 exhausted from combat kabuto sakura and sasuke corner them after a brief struggle naruto knocks out the enemies and takes their scroll at which point they head to the tower and meet with kabutos team unknown to team 7 kabuto submits all of the data he gathered on them to orochimaru  
team 7 opens its scrolls inside the tower summoning iruka to inform them that they made it in time he observes their growth then allows them to enter the main room where they meet with the other passing teams team 10 team 8 team guy the sand siblings kabutos team and team dosu hiruzen briefly speaks about what the exams are all about before entrusting hayate gekko to oversee the matches  
hayate reveals that an unusually large number of genin got through the second stage of the exam a series of one-on-one preliminary matches will be held to reduce the number of people meaning that there will be a tournament for the next exam eliminating the loser and promoting the victor kabuto drops out immediately upon the notice blaming his withdrawal on an injury sustained from an earlier part of the test the preliminary matches are randomized with a machine and the dials end at sasuke vs yoroi beginning with sasuke uchiha versus yoroi akado but before sasuke heads into battle sakura tries to stop him saying that he will lose and get hurt severely if he doesnt use any chakra because it will surely awaken the cursed seals power  
sasuke fights yoroi but is handicapped by his inability to use chakra due to the danger of activating the cursed seal yorois ability to absorb chakra gives him an advantage but sasuke in the heat of battle invents a new signature jutsu on the spot that can only be used by him and uses a new taijutsu technique the lions barrage a jutsu that consists of sasuke launching his opponent in to the air usually with a kick on the neck sasuke tricks his opponent with a pretend attack and does a real one sasuke instructs three more blows with lion rage and then kicks his opponent down and for the finishing blow he does a frontflip kick down to the ground sasuke after using the barrage he even still manages to suppress his cursed seal in the process and sasuke wins his exam match kakashi takes him to an isolated location to hinder the cursed seal only to be confronted by orochimaru as he finishes back at the tower shino aburame and zaku abumi begin the next match  
kakashi threatens to kill orochimaru a threat that orochimaru takes lightly despite this orochimaru leaves with kakashi terrified at his foolishness meanwhile shino and zaku abumi continue their match with shino ultimately winning his match through the use of his destruction bugs leaving kankuro and misumi tsurugi to fight next  
kankuro easily wins his battle against misumi by tricking him into attacking karasu kankuros puppet in retaliation karasu snaps misumis neck though he survives due to his ability to contort himself the fourth match is between sakura haruno vs ino yamanaka after the two exchange insults they have flash backs from when they were kids they then decide to take the battle seriously  
sakura and ino are evenly matched they both use illusion clone jutsu chakra string jutsu and others finally ino tries a desperate move her mind body switch technique she succeeds and takes control over sakuras body as she prepares to force sakura to forfeit naruto believing in sakura as her teammate and cheers sakura on and like a voice of reason or a spiritual hand narutos cheering voice awakens sakura and inadvertently awakens her inner sakura who forces ino out of her body in a brutal and physical force both drained of their chakra ino and sakura decide to end the battle with a giant final cha blow they dash towards each other with all theyre power inserted into one fist each the rivals both at the same with a punch on their both of their faces each and knock each other out resulting in a double knockout tie and eliminating both from the finals  
the next match is between temari and tenten tentens weapon summonings are negated by temaris wind-based attacks and she is defeated shikamaru nara and kin tsuchi are chosen for the next match although kin ensnares shikamaru in a genjutsu he captures her in his shadow imitation technique he forces her to knock herself unconscious the next combatants are randomized putting everyone into awaiting excitements and in the end are revealed to be naruto and kiba inuzuka  
kiba quickly embarrasses naruto by sending him tumbling to the ground with one intense blow but he soon discovers that naruto will not be taken down so easily kiba and his dog continue to prove too much for naruto he uses his superior strength and speed to dominate the match consuming special military pills that enhance their chakra kiba and akamaru use a combination of their speed and special signature jutsu to overwhelm naruto  
as the battle continues naruto manages to trick kiba into knocking akamaru out despite this naruto is still at a disadvantage due to kibas pill-enhanced chakra as well as his superior strength and speed kiba proves to be too fast for naruto to the point that naruto doesnt even have time to perform any jutsu using his speed to get behind naruto kiba is about to land a finishing blow before he can make contact however naruto unintentionally stops kiba in his tracks by farting in his face due to kibas special clan abilities his sense of smell is 1000 times greater than that of a normal person making the fart 1000 times worse taking advantaged of a disabled kiba naruto then attacks and defeats kiba with a lethal combination attack of his shadow clones  
the next match is hinata hyuga against neji hyuga her cousin from the branch house of the hyuga clan neji intimidates and berates his cousin and she seems ready to forfeit tired of his taunts naruto cheers hinata on giving her the strength to fight back hinata and neji fight each other using gentle fist style which uses bursts of chakra to damage the opponents internal organs  
neji reveals that he had been toying with hinata and he disables her ability to use chakra with the gentle fist style hinata inspired by naruto refuses to give up she tells neji that she believes that he is suffering more from fighting his destiny angered neji attempts a fatal blow but four observing jonin halt him hinata collapses into cardiac arrest shortly after and naruto vows to avenge her  
the next set of matchups is rock lee against gaara at first lees strong fist taijutsu is ineffective against gaaras wall of sand that automatically rises to protect him lee then removes the heavy leg weights he was wearing drastically increasing his speed and allowing him to bypass gaaras defense lee then uses his primary lotus but only succeeds in destroying a clone made of sand  
gaara reappears and attacks lee who is weakened from using his primary lotus again lee recovers by opening the second gate shocking the jonin observers in the audience he then proceeds to open the third and fourth gates shocking gaara  
lees increased speed overwhelms gaaras sand defenses lee opens the fifth gate and uses his most powerful attack hidden lotus lees power accuracy strength and speed increase outstandingly allowing lee to inflict extreme injuries on garra with a 5th gate barrage of his unfortunately for lee gaara survives by softening his fall with sand and uses his sand coffin to crush lees left arm and leg gaara moves his sand to finish lee but guy blocks the final attack lee though unconscious due to the pain and covered in blood rises to continue the battle his desire to win fueling his broken body at the end of the match rock lee is crippled to the extent that he is unable to fight again guy regrets teaching lee such dangerous techniques but vacates the ring for the final match between choji akimichi and dosu kinuta  
despite having formulated a strategy beforehand choji quickly loses to dosu concluding the preliminaries the nine qualifying genin are assigned opponents and they are all allowed to leave for a month of training before the finals elsewhere kabuto prepares to kidnap sasuke under orochimarus orders but he is stopped by kakashi and is forced to retreat naruto later meets with kakashi in hopes of training with him but is given ebisu as a replacement  
naruto reluctantly agrees to train under ebisu and ebisu tries to teach naruto how to walk on water as naruto practices ebisu catches an old man later revealed to be jiraiya spying on a womens bathhouse as ebisu rushes to apprehend him jiraiya knocks him out with a single hit leaving naruto without a tutor  
after jiraiya knocks out ebisu naruto is left without a tutor naruto manages to convince jiraiya to tutor him by using the sexy technique while jiraiya oversees narutos training he quickly realizes that naruto is the container of the nine-tails jiraiya unlocks the seal that orochimaru had placed on naruto in the forest and naruto quickly grasps the concept of walking on water afterwards jiraiya speaks with naruto about his two kinds of chakra  
that night dosu kinuta a finalist for the chunin exams attempts to assassinate gaara but gaara quickly kills him observing from a distance baki and kabuto yakushi confer about the planned invasion of konohagakure by sunagakure and otogakure their conversation is overheard by hayate gekko despite the latters swordsmanship and skills he is quickly dispatched by baki the next day naruto resumes his training with jiraiya he signs a scroll that will allow him to summon toads upon trying to summon a toad naruto only manages to summon a tadpole  
sakura visits the hospital to see sasuke but finds that sasuke has left while there sakura checks on rock lee despite the injuries that have taken away his hopes of becoming a ninja lee trains to regain his strength the training causes him too much pain and he passes out elsewhere the many finalists continue their training with naruto finally managing to summon a tadpole with hind-legs sasuke himself is off training with kakashi  
jiraiya realizes that narutos training is taking too long and decides to use drastic measures knowing that naruto can only tap into the foxs chakra during life-or-death situations jiraiya takes naruto to a local chasm and throws him in unable to stop himself from falling naruto enters his subconsciousness and converses with the fox asking for a donation of its strength the fox complies and naruto manages to summon gamabunta to stop his descent  
gamabunta is angry that he has been summoned in a pit and even angrier that naruto is sitting on top of his head although naruto informs gamabunta that he summoned him gamabunta does not believe him determined to prove himself naruto rides atop gamabuntas head until sunset while gamabunta tries to shake him off naruto falls shortly before sunset but he earns gamabuntas respect in the process gamabunta then takes naruto to the hospital to rest  
when naruto awakens he finds shikamaru nara sitting by his bed bringing him a basket of fruit the two locate gaara elsewhere in the hospital and halt his attempt to assassinate rock lee gaara explains that his reason for existing is to kill everyone and reveals that he like naruto was alone for much of his childhood hated and feared by others for being a host of a tailed beast gaara prepares to kill naruto and shikamaru as well but is stopped by the arrival of might guy lees sensei and leaves  
on the day of the finals naruto makes his way to the arena along the way he encounters and converses with hinata hyuga hinata reassures him of his talents removing any doubts he had about the finals naruto thanks hinata and goes on his way as he gets closer to the arena naruto meets konohamaru who tries to use a number of shortcuts to help naruto get to the arena faster the shortcuts end up being ineffective and time consuming as a result naruto makes it to the stadium late but can still enter  
naruto begins his match with neji hyuga who naruto promised to defeat a month earlier during the preliminaries since taijutsu proves ineffective naruto creates a large number of shadow clones though neji is able to destroy them all naruto creates more  
naruto creates more shadow clones and this time manages to sneak up on neji before he can land a blow neji uses a powerful defensive technique then follows up with another technique to block narutos chakra even though he can no longer fight naruto refuses to give up and berates neji over how he treated hinata neji then reveals the history of the hyuga clan and how his father was killed to save the life of his uncle he reaffirms his belief in the unchanging nature of ones destiny  
determined to prove neji wrong naruto draws on the demon foxs strength surprising many of the older ninja present with his ability to use the foxs chakra following an explosive clash between the two naruto manages to defeat neji through the use of a shadow clone as a decoy after telling neji to stop putting so much faith in fate naruto is declared the winner  
when neji is taken away to recover his uncle tries to tell neji the truth of his fathers death saying that he had given up his life to save his brother not a member of the main house neji is unbelieving but his reading his fathers final letter and seeing his uncle bowing for forgiveness causes him to realize the truth meanwhile the match between sasuke uchiha and gaara is postponed due to sasukes absence and the match between shino aburame and kankuro is set to start kankuro forfeits and the next combatants shikamaru and temari go down to the stadium  
though initially unwilling shikamaru fights temari because he refuses to lose to a girl shikamaru quickly studies the arena and its elements and comes up with a plan despite this temari has seen shikamarus primary attack in action and knows how it works shikamaru relies on strategy to defeat his opponent but it becomes evident that temari is a keen strategist too however shikamarus strategies are superior and enable him to capture temari with his jutsu but he forfeits as he has no chakra left to fight  
with sasuke and gaaras match needing to start the third hokage sets a time limit for sasuke to arrive sasuke arrives at the last minute with kakashi hatake meanwhile gaara kills a pair of ninjas who are attempting to fix the match on his way to enter the arena  
sasukes enhanced speed and taijutsu skills enable him to bypass gaaras sand-based defenses with ease as rock lee did previously determined to kill sasuke gaara retreats inside a sphere of sand and begins to transform  
to break through gaaras defense sasuke uses his new jutsu chidori with it sasuke is able to pierce gaaras shield stopping his transformation at that moment kabuto yakushi uses a genjutsu to put the audience to sleep signaling the start of the invasion of konoha  
revealing himself to have killed the fourth kazekage to get to him orochimaru takes hiruzen hostage as he has his personal bodyguards the sound four establish a barrier to so no one would interfere meanwhile invading sound and sand ninja infiltrate konoha and battles begin breaking out across the village kankuro and temari carry gaara from the village so that he can recover with sasuke in pursuit preoccupied with fending off the invading forces kakashi instructs sakura who had managed to repel the sleep-inducing genjutsu to wake naruto and shikamaru  
once naruto and shikamaru awaken the later actually faked sleep kakashi summons pakkun to assist them in tracking down sasuke meanwhile orochimaru begins his battle with hiruzen his mentor before becoming the third hokage both display powerful techniques in what the observing anbu describe as a kage-level battle during the battle orochimaru uses the reanimation jutsu to summon hiruzens deceased predecessors the second hokage tobirama senju who invented the reanimation jutsu and the first hokage hashirama senju the senju brothers apologize to their former student for what is about to happen as orochimaru forces them to fight hiruzen  
as naruto sakura shikamaru and pakkun pursue sasuke it soon becomes apparent that theyre being followed by a group of nine sound ninja shikamaru volunteers to stall them to buy the others time and falls back once the sound ninja get close enough shikamaru traps them with his shadow though he finds that he has only captured eight attempting to kill the eight shikamaru discovers the ninths location but lacks the chakra to trap him as his shadow recedes and the eight freed ninja prepare to kill shikamaru asuma sarutobi shikamarus sensei arrives and defeats all the sound ninja saving shikamaru  
the hokage battle begins with hashiramas wood style giving him and his brother the advantage on hiruzen as he summons enma to help him in the uneven fight as orochimaru brings out his kusanagi sword during the fight hiruzen learns that ninja brought back by the reanimation jutsu are immune to any normal form of attack and regenerate from any injury dealt on them at that time explaining his desire to become immortal to know every form of ninjutsu orochimaru decides to reveal the fruits of his labor by peeling away his face revealing the face of a face of a girl whose body he now occupies  
though temari tries to hold off sasuke so he brothers can escape sasuke easily dispatches her and resumes his chase at the hokage battle orochimaru reveals the nature of his transference ritual that allows him to transfer his being into the body of another every few years and that he intends to make sasuke his new vessel regretting not killing orochimaru when he had the chance the night his former student left the village hiruzen musters up his chakra and summons shadow clones for a last resort attack to rectify that mistake  
as the battles across konoha rage on the hiruzen has his clones use the reaper death seal on senjus brothers as the corpses used to reanimate the first two hokage are revealed to be kin and zaku hiruzen reveals that the reaper death seal is a double-edge attack that the fourth hokage used to defeat the nine-tails with his own soul as the price having given up two thirds of his own soul to seal the senju brothers within the reapers stomach hiruzen intends to feed what remained of his own soul and orochimarus soul to the monster as well however orochimaru has his kusanagi stabs the third hokage in the back meanwhile sasuke again catches up with gaara and kankuro prepares to hold sasuke off while gaara escapes with temari before they can begin shino aburame arrives to fight kankuro allowing sasuke to proceed  
leaving shino to deal with kankuro sasuke continues his pursuit of gaara kankuro attacks shino with his puppet using its many hidden weapons to catch shino by surprise shino is able to dodge the attacks through the use of his destruction bugs but eventually makes the mistake of inhaling some of the puppets poison gas as the battle goes on shino directs his bugs to kankuros location they consume his chakra once they get there causing kankuro to collapse the battle won shino also collapses due to kankuros poison sasuke catches up with gaara as shinos battle ends and the two resume their match  
gaara begins transforming into shukaku dramatically increasing his strength and speed sasuke uses his chidori to slice gaaras arm off but the pain only makes gaara more determined and excited to kill sasuke unable to use the chidori a third time sasuke is forced to use his cursed seal so that he can attack gaara again this fails to defeat him and sasuke collapses due to the use of the cursed seal as gaara prepares to inflict the finishing blow naruto repels the attack with a kick naruto sakura and pakkun arrive ready to help sasuke  
gaara tries to attack sasuke again but is covered by sakura who got in the way gaara pushes sakura out of the way while naruto grabs sasukes body and saves him gaara remembers his childhood with his maternal uncle yashamaru while yashamaru had for many years been the only person who seemed to care for him gaara is shocked to find yashamaru suddenly attacking him out of sheer hatred  
as gaara continues to reminisce about yashamaru he remembers yashamarus statement of his mothers death and his uncles suicide bombing though gaara survived the blast - thanks to the sand shield - he lost the only person who ever cared for him from that point on gaara came to love only himself and started to find purpose in killings others returning to the present gaara keeps his grip on sakura with his sand claw choking her to death gaara feeling deranged asks naruto to play a game with him saying that if he can beat him sakura will be set free determined to save sakura at all costs and win her affection an enraged naruto violently attacks gaara and they engage in battle  
naruto has been afraid of gaara ever since he met him but now narutos determination is awakened truly along with the will of fire rejuvenated naruto uses techniques from his ninja handbook scroll naruto unleashes new and improved naruto uzumaki barrage consisting of 2000 shadow clones naruto uzumaki 2k barrage 8 shadow clones kicked gaara into the air and all 2000 shadow clones punched gaara on every inch of his body before 2 shadow clones delivered a the final blow to the barrage naruto attempts a 2nd attack twice as powerful with kicks to fend off the attack gaara completes his transformation into a replica of the one tail gaara tries to crush naruto with his sand thinking of sakura and his friends naruto uses his own chakra to summon gamabunta gaara forces himself to sleep and allows shukaku to take over needing to get close to shukaku to wake gaara up naruto and gamabunta transform into a replica of the nine-tails to fight  
as the transformed gamabunta holds shukaku in place naruto awakens gaara tapping into the foxs power again naruto headbutts gaara and destroys shukakus form across konoha the villages ninja including the parents of many of the genin begin the counterattack of the invading forces at the site of his battle with orochimaru hiruzen realizes that he does not have enough strength left to fully seal orochimarus soul and instead opts to seal the part of his former pupils soul within his arms robbing orochimaru his ability to use jutsu hiruzens bids his enraged student a fond farewell as he dies reciting one last proverb at this time naruto and gaara jump at each other and naruto succeeds in throwing the winning blow  
critically damaged orochimaru calls off the invasion and flees the village with his forces in the forest naruto and gaara both lay on the ground devoid of chakra naruto sympathizes with gaara for his childhood but threatens to kill gaara if he should ever bring harm to his friends again realizing that narutos strength came from the desire to protect others gaara begins to reshape his view of the world as his siblings take him home and apologizes to temari and kankuro the next day the ninja of konoha mourn the deaths of those who died during the invasion especially hiruzen as they ponder the meaning of the third hokages sacrifice  
after hiruzens death revealed to be pupil alongside orochimaru jiraiya is approached by the villages elders as they offer him the position of fifth hokage he declines saying that his former team mate tsunade would be a much better candidate for the title jiraiya offers to find her for konoha and asks that he be allowed to take naruto with him meanwhile itachi uchiha and kisame hoshigaki enter konoha and are confronted by asuma sarutobi and kurenai yuhi itachi and kisame quickly gain the advantage in battle but kakashi comes to their rescue at the last moment  
kakashi and itachi exchange blows each being very proficient with the sharingan itachi neutralizes kakashi with his tsukuyomi as kakashi struggles to remain standing he asks itachi why hes returned to konoha itachi replies that theyre after naruto which kakashi elaborates as meaning they want the demon fox for their organization akatsuki angered that kakashi knows of their organization itachi instructs kisame to kill asuma and kurenai but to bring kakashi with him before kisame can do so might guy arrives itachi states he did not go to konoha to start a war so he and kisame left the battle  
guy asuma and kurenai take an unconscious kakashi home to rest where they decide sasuke should not know of itachis return despite their wishes sasuke finds out and also learns that itachi is after naruto determined to kill itachi for murdering the uchiha clan sasuke rushes out to find naruto though discovers that naruto has already left the village with jiraiya in another town naruto sits in a hotel room while jiraiya tries to pick up women after someone knocks on his door naruto opens it to reveal itachi and kisame standing before him  


in a flashback sasuke reminisces the night his entire clan was killed and how he came home to find his parents dead and itachi standing over them confronting his brother sasuke is subject to itachis tsukuyomi who shows him how he killed the clan causing sasuke to collapse from the experience back in present time as kisame and itachi contemplate how best to carry naruto sasuke arrives and attacks itachi with his chidori uninterested in their quarrel itachi effortlessly stops the attack naruto attempts to summon a toad but kisame absorbs his chakra before he can do so and proceeds to attack jiraiya arrives to block the attack  
although jiraiya prepares to fight the two akatsuki members sasuke proclaims that he will kill itachi itachi brutally beats and berates his brother even using tsukuyomi sasuke falls unconscious and jiraiya uses the ensuing chaos to prepare a powerful technique forcing the akatsuki team to flee might guy arrives and takes sasuke back to konoha before he leaves he asks that naruto and jiraiya to find tsunade hoping that she will be able to heal lees injuries they reassure him and naruto and jiraiya set out to resume their search  
naruto enjoys a day out on the town while jiraiya does some investigating into tsunades whereabouts when jiraiya ends up using his time - and narutos money - to enjoy sake and women he starts teaching naruto the rasengan after a conflict with ex-chunnin ninjas to begin learning the technique naruto must pop a water-filled balloon held in the palm of his hand by spinning the water with his chakra something he starts with great enthusiasm  
soon after his training begins naruto finds himself unable to make any progress after asking jiraiya for tips naruto decides he will master the jutsu in three days jiraiya doubts the likelihood that naruto will live up this promise explaining that the rasengan was developed by the fourth hokage in a duration of three years he then goes on to explain that popping the balloon is only one of three steps and leaves naruto to resume his trainingnaruto soon discovers that popping the balloon is easier if he uses both of his hands after observing a cat and progresses to the second step the second stage requires the bursting of a rubber ball naruto tries for weeks and eventually manages to burst the ball but with great struggle and pain  
the second step involves naruto popping a rubber ball something that will require much more power after naruto struggles with this step jiraiya helps him by drawing a leaf on his palm to give him a point to concentrate his efforts on with some additional practice naruto is able to complete this stage as well elsewhere tsunade an avid and extremely unlucky gambler hits a winning streak leading her to believe something bad is about to happen she is correct as when she tries to leave the city she is met by orochimaru and kabuto  
naruto is tasked with combining the spinning and the power developed in the previous steps something that jiraiya cannot help him with as he attempts to do both a frail and sickly orochimaru asks tsunade to heal his soulless decayed arms as the effects of the reaper death seal inflicted on him are causing him excruciating pain although she has no intentions of helping orochimaru due to his killing their teacher tsunade decides to consider the matter when he offers to revive her dead brother nawaki and lover dan  
orochimaru gives tsunade a week to think about it and he leaves while tsunade has dinner that night jiraiya and naruto arrive at the same bar suspicious of jiraiyas reason for looking for her tsunade asks what he wants to which he replies that konoha wants her to be the new hokage she rejects the offer saying anyone who would willingly take the title is a fool naruto enraged that she would disrespect the title of hokage and those who have held its position challenges tsunade to a battle the two step outside but tsunade quickly proves to be far out of narutos league unwilling to give up naruto readies his imperfect rasengan for an attack  
recognizing the danger the attack imposes tsunade forces it into the ground where the minor damage it inflicts indicates that it is not yet complete despite this tsunade offers naruto a proposition if he can master the technique in one week shell give him her necklace something worth an immense amount of money if he cannot she gets all the money in his wallet naruto agrees to the bet and leaves to start training tsunade meets jiraiya for drinks where he tells her that he is aware orochimaru has offered her something jiraiya makes it clear that he will kill her if she helps orochimaru meanwhile naruto continues to train intent on winning the bet with tsunade  
as the week goes by naruto continues his training though he is unable to properly mix spinning and power and has varying results tsunade watches narutos progress from the background noting how similar he is to both nawaki and dan once a week goes by naruto appears to have been unsuccessful and lays unconscious with fatigue jiraiya still uncertain about the situation with orochimaru &amp tsunade decides to take her out for drinks and reminds her about the bet with naruto while theyre out together tsunade drugs his drink putting him to sleep the next morning tsunade meets with orochimaru as promised and prepares to heal his arms before she can do so she is stopped by kabuto  
having recognized that tsunades healing jutsu was filled with killing intent kabuto realized that she had no intention of helping orochimaru with tsunade being the only person who can heal orochimaru kabuto decides to force her to help as they begin to fight although tsunade has far more battle experience than kabuto he is able to hold his own against her even managing to land a few debilitating attacks as kabuto prepares to put tsunade out of commission naruto jiraiya and tsunades assistant shizune arrive to help uninterested in their assistance tsunade tries to resume her battle with kabuto until he learns of her hemophobia and uses it against her as she is taken aside to recover naruto and shizune both launch attacks at kabuto which he defeats finally jiraiya states that he and shizune must team up to take on orochimaru and kabuto respectively  
with tsunade out of commission due to her paralyzing fear of blood jiraiya takes on the challenge of defeating orochimaru kabuto continues to insult tsunade which angers naruto and gives him the strength to fight kabuto and protect tsunade however naruto is no match for kabuto who picks on naruto and brings back tsunades memories of nawaki dan and the bet made between her and naruto naruto in the heat of battle on the spot creates a unique method using a shadow clone to help divide the roles of rotating the chakra and is able to pull together all the strength he has left to make one final attack with his right hand creating a shadow clone and pulling off a complete rasengan having have defeated kabuto naruto passes out after mastering the new jutsu  
despite using a powerful healing technique kabutos wounds are too extensive for him to deal with when naruto collapses due to the severity of kabutos last attack a strike to narutos heart tsunade does what she can determined to save him and his dream of becoming hokage her efforts work and he regains consciousness long enough to claim the necklace he has won in the bet orochimaru recognizing naruto as a potential future threat tries to kill him tsunade determined to make sure naruto becomes hokage overcomes her fear of blood and uses herself as a human shield to block the attack when asked why she would risk her life to save him tsunade replies that it is her duty as the fifth hokage finally accepting the role she was offered intending to eliminate his former teammates orochimaru summons manda while tsunade and jiraiya summon katsuyu and gamabunta respectively  
katsuyu and gamabunta double-team manda though the latter is able to hold his own using her inhuman strength tsunade is able to pin manda down and delivers a finishing blow to orochimaru deciding to use his last resort to regain the use of his arms orochimaru retreats with kabuto leaving tsunade jiraiya shizune and naruto to their own devices once naruto recovers and learns of tsunades acceptance of the hokage title he remarks that she is an undeserving of the job because the third was better in every possible way the two step outside to have another fight though this time tsunade gives naruto a kiss on the forehead instead of a blow to the face the group then sets off for konoha  
on their way back to konoha the group takes a break at a hot spring town naruto learns that two ninja of the akagi family cannot return home unless they collect tsunades debts and attempts to help them shizune fearing that tsunades debts if exposed would jeopardize her chances of becoming hokage disguises herself as tsunade to stop naruto but neither of them realizes that the debt had already been paid  
upon arriving in konoha preparations are made to formally put tsunade into office though she is largely uninterested in formalities and leaves the task to her new assistants she makes her rounds in the konoha hospital healing kakashi and sasuke of the damage done to their minds by itachis tsukuyomi when examining the wounds to rock lees body tsunade discovers that the damage to his spine is too extensive even for her to heal with certainty she advises lee to give up on his dreams of being a ninja citing that there is only a 50% chance that he will survive the operation  
unable to escape tsunade as her grandfathers successor konohamaru does everything in his power to prevent her inauguration as tsunade does research hoping to increase the chances of lees surviving the operation naruto tries to convince konohamaru that she will be a good hokage after tsunade demonstrates her strength and healing abilities konohamaru decides tsunade can be hokage and that his grandfather will not fade into memory  
guy and lee discuss the operation and lee expresses his fears of dying as well as his fears of never being a ninja the two reminisce about their time together and guy finally decides that if lee dies during the operation so will he as he cannot live if lee is not a ninja guys words inspire lee and he decides to take the operation tsunade meanwhile manages to increase the odds of lees survival to 58% and is satisfied that lee will most likely survive the operation tsunade is inaugurated as hokage and the role of the villages protector is passed on to her  
in this episode based on a special omake naruto convinces sakura and sasuke to help him see what kakashis face looks like under his mask each one of their plans such as buying him ramen to force him to remove his mask while he eats fails in a comedic fashion at the same time they inadvertently and unknowingly thwart attempts by three ninja to kill kakashi for goofy reasons finally kakashi agrees to take off his mask revealing another slightly paler mask beneath it  
team 7 without kakashi is given a mission to protect a young man idate during his foot race against a rival clan that will settle the feud between the two idate however has a strong distaste for ninja at the start of the race he runs off in the wrong direction confusing everyone  
team 7 follows idate to another port which makes for a better starting point of the boating part of the race due to the winds and the current en route they are attacked by the rain ninja from the chunin exam who have been hired by the other clan team 7 defends idate and tell him to swim for the shore while they follow later he does so but is confronted by aoi an amegakure ninja  
aoi taunts idate and attacks him team 7 who are still swimming for the island are attacked underwater by the rain ninja using the first step of training for the rasengan naruto creates a huge whirlpool that saves them they then try to rescue idate but prove to be no match for aoi who poisons them and leaves sakura gives them all medicine tsunade had given her and they seek shelter in a cave idate explains that he was once a leaf ninja but was tricked by aoi into betraying the village after failing the chunin exam  
fukusuke continues to celebrate with women and food when aoi warns him that he might be celebrating prematurely naruto uzumaki carrying idate ascends the long flight of stairs to the modoroki shrine idate grabs the orb and heads out on his own two feet but they are soon confronted by aoi waiting with tobiramas sword of raijin that he had idate steal for him both narutos rasengan and sasukes chidori are repelled by the sword though the latter is able to crack it slightly  
when sakura haruno and sasuke uchiha are defeated it is up to naruto to defeat aoi so idate can continue the race after a few failed attacks naruto is finally able to defeat aoi which means idate can continue the race though fukusuke is already near the finish line with determination and encouragement from naruto idate manages to catch up and win the race saving the wasabi clan  
as shikamaru is officially promoted to chunin while lee accepts undergoing the operation sasuke is recuperating in the hospital after the injuries he received in the land of tea angry and jealous that naruto has continued to get stronger while he is still not strong enough to defeat itachi he challenges naruto to a fight when he and sakura come to visit naruto accepts and the two head to the roof after exchanging several attacks naruto creates a rasengan and sasuke prepares his chidori the two rush towards each other with sakura screaming for them to stop  
as naruto and sasuke are about to clash kakashi hatake appears and deflects them into differing water towers sasuke finds narutos tower to be considerably worse off and only comes to envy narutos strength more upon seeing the actual damage kakashi takes sasuke aside and lectures him about not attacking friends sasuke said if anyone get killed who means something to him maybe he listen kakashi then tells him that he is too late to test it out because they are all already dead kakashi tells sasuke that revenge will not truly bring happiness to him and is the wrong answer and leaves him trusting he will not choose vengeance meanwhile sakura asks naruto on a date that he had asked her a long time ago when they were first assinged to team 7 while sasuke debates on whether to stay with the village or take revenge on itachi the sound four arrive and attack him  
sasuke continues his battle with the sound four but eventually becomes too injured including being weakened by using the curse mark the sound four tell stories of how sasuke can become stronger if he lended himself to orochimaru sasuke tired of playing ninja games finally gives in and goes to them sakura tries to stop him but fails as sasuke vanishes before she can persuade him more and he knocks sakura unconscious after saying thank you  
when sakura awakens she informs tsunade of sasukes defection unable to send higher ranking ninja after sasuke tsunade orders shikamaru nara to assemble a team of genin under his lead to go after sasuke he selects naruto neji hyuga choji akimichi and kiba inuzuka and quickly devises the optimal formation for the group before they leave sakura pleads to naruto to make sure to bring sasuke back naruto promises to do so and the group sets out  
as the first step in gaining power sasukes cursed seal must be advanced to its second state for this to happen the sound four seals sasuke into a barrel and carry him from konoha as his seal advances they are confronted by two nearby konoha ninja raido namiashi and genma shiranui but eventually defeat them thanks to their cursed seals after carrying sasuke for a ways the sound four takes a break giving the recently caught up retrieval team a chance to try a sneak attack their presence is detected and the sound four attacks them before they can make a move  
although the sound fours attack seems to force the retrieval team on the defensive shikamaru intended to be caught and uses the opportunity to capture the sound four with his shadow they manage to escape and jirobo captures the retrieval team in a dome of rocks as the other sound four members go on ahead jirobo absorbs the konoha ninjas chakra before their chakra is completely absorbed choji manages to break out of the dome freeing the team  
freed choji volunteers to stay behind and deal with jirobo to give the rest of the team a chance to catch up to the other sound four members as the team goes on choji eats the first of the akimichis three colored pills increasing his strength doing so proves enough to overpower jirobo forcing him to advance his cursed seal to its first level with jirobo now having the upper hand choji takes the second akimichi pill  
with the second pill in his system choji uses the multi-size technique to dramatically increase his size and fall upon jirobo to escape the crushing effects of chojis increased bulk jirobo advances to level 2 of his cursed seal enabling him to lift choji and toss him aside outmatched choji considers taking the last pill while all of the pills he has taken thus far have been harmful to him the third almost guarantees death to the user thinking of shikamaru nara  choji takes the pill allowing him to easily overpower and kill jirobo his battle won choji begins to follow his friends path though falls unconscious before making it very far  
when the retrieval team catches up with the sound four they are quickly caught in kidomarus webs as kidomaru is about to finish off naruto neji frees himself from the webbings and saves the rest of the team because only his gentle fist style can break kidomarus chakra-infused webbing neji decides to deal with him himself instructs the others to go on without him and begins to fight kidomarukidomaru finds out how neji can cut his webbingsalthough kidomaru soon believes himself to have the advantage neji readies his eight trigrams sixty-four palms to prove him wrong  
kidomaru manages to shield himself from the attack and flees to the safety of the neighboring trees deciding to attack neji from a distance kidomaru advances his seal to its first level and sends multiple spiders to attack neji neji is able to repel them all though kidomaru notices a delayed reaction in some of nejis blocks he theorizes that nejis defenses has a blind spot and attacks him further from this blind spot his theory is proven correct as neji is unable to block the attack believing himself to have found nejis weakness kidomaru prepares to finish the battle  
after advancing his cursed seal to its second state and creating a bow and arrow with his webs kidomaru begins taking shots at nejis blind spot neji is able to block the attacks enough to keep them from hitting vital areas though is still left heavily damaged with each of kidomarus attacks ready to finish the battle kidomaru prepares his most deadly arrow for use and fires it at neji neji takes the arrow full force though already knowing of his blind spot moves at the last second to keep the arrow from piercing his heart with kidomarus arrow connected to him by a web neji sends his chakra into the web paralyzing kidomaru as kidomaru lies helpless neji approaches him and deals a finishing blow his injuries too severe neji collapses leaving the retrieval of sasuke up to the others  
orochimaru his body left useless after his failed invasion of konoha anxiously waits for sasuke so that he can switch to sasukes body although he puts it off for as long as he can hoping that the sound four will arrive in time his body brings him too much pain and he is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners elsewhere the retrieval team catches up with the sound four and tries to get sasuke back  
soon after the battle begins kiba and his dog akamaru fall off a cliff with sakon shikamaru engages tayuya while naruto goes after kimimaro who is carrying sasukes coffin desperate to get sasuke back naruto begins tapping into the demon foxs chakra to engage kimimaro as the battle between shikamaru and tayuya begins tayuya summons three creatures to help her in combat with kiba and sakons battle already underway elsewhere sakons brother ukon reveals himself to help sakon fight  
as tayuya guides her three beasts after shikamaru she activates the first level of her cursed seal to make controlling them easier naruto too begins his battle creating a great deal of shadow clones with which to attack kimimaro though kimimaro is able to defeat the clones by the dozens as the fight between kiba and akamaru vs sakon and ukon rages on ukon pushes his cursed seal into its second level recognizing the huge increase in strength that this allows the brothers kiba and akamaru combine to become a giant double-headed wolf the combined beast charges towards sakon and ukon though the brothers are able to block the attack as the wolf transformation disperses akamaru is attacked and left heavily injured and ukon merges himself with kibas body needing to get rid of ukon to save akamaru kiba stabs himself in the stomach causing him and ukon to start coughing up blood  
ukon separates from kiba and rejoins with sakon so that he can recover kiba finds akamaru and the two flee down river hoping to escape the brothers naruto meanwhile is unable to make a dent in kimimaro and his shadow clones are still rapidly defeated before they can land a blow shikamaru elsewhere believes to have picked up on the movements of tayuyas creatures though she quickly has them switch actions before shikamaru can act  
despite tayuyas efforts shikamaru has devised a plan to defeat her creatures using a flash bang to lengthen the shadows in the area shikamaru captures the creatures and prepares to turn them against tayuya to prevent this tayuya calls off the creatures making them disperse despite this tayuya is captured by shikamarus shadow forcing her to advance her seal to its second state to escape with tayuya now strong enough to overpower his shadow shikamaru decides instead to use his shadow for attack and attempts to use his shadow to strangle her  
as naruto starts getting frustrated with his lack of progress sasukes cursed seal finally reaches its second level allowing him to exit his coffin and go on ahead kimimaro prevents naruto from going after him though the arrival of the newly recovered rock lee forces him to let naruto go lee and kimimaro begin exchanging blows though kimimaros unique control over his bones makes things difficult for lee soon after the fight begins lee asks for a timeout so that he can take his medicine kimimaro agrees and lee drinks the contents of his medicine bottle because lee grabbed sake instead of medicine when he set out to help the retrieval team lee is immediately intoxicated and attacks kimimaro in a drunken frenzy  
in his drunken form lees movements are unpredictable and kimimaro is left unable to dodge his attacks as lee begins gaining the advantage in the fight kimimaro is forced to use his more powerful abilities lee however begins to sober up and reverts to his previous state easily being outclassed by kimimaro kimimaro prepares to finish lee off tayuya starts fighting shikamarus shadow and sakon and ukon find kiba and akamaru before any of the sound four members can attack the konoha ninja gaara temari and kankuro arrive at each battle site to take care of the sound four members themselves  
the arrival of the sand ninja surprises the konoha retrieval team and the sound four although the konoha ninja ask their saviors to flee each refuses having been asked to come to help by tsunade kibas nose saves kankuro from a sneak attack ukon underestimates kankuro and his puppet reeceding from their cursed-seal state but the latter is soon able to trap both ukon and sakon in a second of his puppets and kill them with temaris arrival tayuya escapes to the surrounding trees for cover though temaris fan cuts through the forest eliminating tayuya with ease  
lee wanting to assist gaara in his fight attacks kimimaro but his bodys too weak and gaara tells him hes only getting in the way gaara unveils his new techniques but kimimaro continues to reapproach him much to lee and gaaras dismay all the while naruto continues his relentless search for sasuke  
recognizing the potency of gaaras attack and the strength of his defenses kimimaro hardens a bone around his arm into the shape of a drill with this his strongest weapon kimimaro charges at gaara though gaaras final defense proves too much and it shatters calling upon the sand in the ground gaara pulls kimimaro deep underground confining him there until his eventual death as kimimaro sinks he creates a forest of bones to burst from the ground which gaara is able to help lee avoid at the last second as the two sit completely exhausted but relieved to have won kimimaro appears from one of the bones with his bone drill for a final attack his disease gets the best of him at the last second and he dies before he can finish gaara and lee elsewhere naruto has caught up to sasuke  
naruto asks sasuke if he is willing to turn his back on all of his friends in konoha for the simple matter of getting stronger sasuke says yes and starts to walk away enraging naruto determined to bring sasuke back to his senses and to konoha naruto grabs hold of him and starts to punch him he makes sasuke spit out blood with every punch then sasuke rallies and easily repels naruto sasuke tells naruto that he doesnt dream of the future only the past as he recalls his close bond with his older brother itachi naruto tries using force again and attacks sasuke but sasuke doges it and uses dragon flame jutsu and sends it towards naruto  
naruto rises from the flames unharmed and sasuke remembers his childhood while doing battle with his enemy itachi used to be a cheerful uchiha and a good brother while being the uchihas best anbu captains fugaku uchiha always favored itachi best sasuke tries to best itachi without success until itachi begins to become more distant from the clan and started to rebel against the uchihas  
sasuke and narutos fight progresses slowly as sasuke continues to remember his childhood in his memories sasuke learns the fire ball jutsu thus gaining his fathers attention as fugaku uchiha tells him not to follow his brothers foot steps he then starts to wonder if he is only to replace his brother his mother confirms everything else is okay however after doing this he remembers heading to school and deciding that he will not lose to itachi in the present time naruto and sasuke begin to fight  
as sasukes remembrance of his childhood draws to a close sasuke returned home from the academy one day to find all the members of the uchiha clan murdered upon finding his parents bodies sasuke discovered itachi to be responsible for the massacre using his mangekyo sharingan itachi showed sasuke their parents deaths causing sasuke to run with fright itachi stopped him telling him that he wasnt worth killing as itachi left he informed sasuke that if he wanted to take revenge for the clan he would need to get stronger to help sasuke gain the strongest ability of the uchiha itachi tells sasuke the requirements to obtain his own mangekyo sharingan he must kill his closest friend with that itachi left leaving sasuke to build a hate for his brother resolving to get stronger sasuke decided he would do whatever was necessary to kill itachi returning to the present day he tells naruto that he will kill him because naruto is his best friend

after sheppards return with refugees from athos atlantis moments away from being crushed breaks away from the ocean floor rising to the surface just before the shield fails now given a chance to rescue his people sheppard needs to make weir see things his way 
eager to experiment with new technology dr mckay volunteers to be dr becketts first patient for his new ata gene therapy now able to use a personal shield emitter mckay recklessly tests its properties only to find that it could lead to his death elsewhere a living shadow entity threatens the city after it was accidentally released from a container where the ancients were studying it it roams the city looking for energy to feed on and the more it feeds the more lethal it becomes finally members of the atlantis expedition manage to send it to planet m4x-337 
needing medical attention sheppards puddle jumper races to atlantis only to become lodged in the stargate now they only have 38 minutes until the stargate automatically dis-engages and the jumper gets cut in two leaving them to asphyxiate in outer space first appearance of radek zelenka david nykl 
when the offworld teams are attacked one time too many dr weir must consider that there is an athosian spy in their midst but upon further investigation all evidence points to teyla feeling betrayed the athosians resettle to the newly-discovered mainland

exploring the planet sheppard and teyla discover a colossal storm with the ability to crush the city in its current state the manarians first mentioned in underground give shelter to most of the atlantis expedition mckay and zelenka think of a daring way to power up the shield but its no coincidence that the genii invade the city at their weakest moment first appearance of acastus kolya robert davi

inspecting the city for storm damage a party of scientists unleash a virus that causes hallucinations and eventually death now nearly a third of atlantis residents have been infected forcing a lockdown its up to sheppard to keep it from spreading and eliminate it for good 
searching a new planet the wraith find the team only for them to be shot down by a mysterious weapon on the surface they find a primitive world named proculus that would make ideal sanctuary for those fleeing from the wraith but the inhabitants believe their goddess wont permit it

the team searches for a zero point module rumored to be hidden on the planet dagan an old lantean outpost the ancestors of the daganians the sudarians were entrusted with a zpm some 10000 years ago in attempt to locate and excavate the zpm the team crosses paths with kolya once more but its not the only thing to worry about when their new allies have motives of their own 
with the wraith fast approaching to claim the city atlantis must somehow send a message back to earth for a desperate attempt in survival meanwhile sheppard and teyla go offworld to try to find more intel on the wraith fleet but end up with a few hitchhikers 
plagued by terrifying nightmares teyla tries to dive into her past offworld where she finds an abandoned wraith lab bringing back the findings dr beckett makes a surprising discovery in her dna makeup leading to a possible way to gather information from their enemy 
mckay leads a team to activate the ancients orbital weapons platform to destroy the hive ships on the final stretch to the city after the team has found a potential atlantis alpha site m1k-439 as planet waterfall the tyrannosaurus-like planet m1m-316 the genii-infested m4h-212 and m85-393 with intense daytime temperatures were rejected the citys personnel are preparing for evacuation when they discover the kamikaze dart pilot the brotherhood has survived in the city

the grand championship starts in earnest with joey facing off against the mysterious apdnarg otom or grandpa solomon moto backwards who allegedly begged to be in the tournament solomon turns joeys reliance on luck against him and leads an assault with the ancient giant  
joey is being beaten by his former teacher solomon moto who sacrifices most of his cards to summon the legendary ancient dragon a card hes been waiting to play for years slowly joey begins a comeback using gilford the lightning to destroy the dragon but its futile as it immediately resurrects itself with ancient city joey counters this by returning it to solomons hand with giant trunade and launching a double assault with gilford the lightning and goblin attack force

joey is pitted against zigfried who previously defeated two duelists in one move using one card after a bad start the facilities around kaibaland go haywire even putting the duelists themselves in danger all zigfrieds work in an attempt to give kaiba a hint after joey makes a stinging direct attack with jinzo zigfried focuses back on the duel playing the ride of the valkyries card he used last time against rex and weevil which easily defeated them in one turn  
with the aid of his hyper refresh joey survives with only 800 life points remaining zigfried decides to try a different tactic

leon is stopped by zigfried and is given a card to his deck for his battle against yugi for the title of world champion leon is unusually bitter about it and oddly considering his last duel doesnt appear to be enjoying himself he launches countless assaults replacing destroyed monsters with more fairytale creatures and reveals he too is a von schroder despite this kaiba cannot call off the match as that is against the tournament rules  
leon reveals his motivation to duel stemming from being ignored by his family in favor of the smart highly gifted and talented zigfried to distract himself leon became engrossed in fairytales and started dueling following the creation of a set of fairytale cards he initially believed this was earning zigfrieds respect but in reality his older brother saw him as little more than a tool for destroying kaibacorp determined to earn his elder brothers love leon plays an illegal field spell the golden castle of stromberg which infects kaibacorps systems with an extremely powerful and dangerous computer virus that rapidly deletes the files and cant be destroyed by card or trap effects  
yugi decides to help leon get rid of the golden castle of stromberg but this proves to be challenging as not only is it unaffected by card effects it forces all monsters to battle and discards half of yugis deck each turn this proves to be its undoing however as hes left with one card and so cant discard half of it destroying the card leon fights valiantly but loses to yugis dark magician zigfried is furious with this but leon manages to calm him down and forgives him yugi and his best friends are finally able to go back home

thief king bakura succeeds in reviving zorc necrophades sacrificing himself and his diabound in the process resulting in both him and diabound being disintegrated and then being absorbed into the millennium stone as zorc emerges from underneath kul elna his energy destroys the millennium stone causing the millennium items to scatter throughout kul elna meanwhile yugi and yami bakura duel possessing the body of tristan if yugi wins he can leave and tell the pharaoh his true name and if he loses hell never leave and he will lose his soul to the shadow realm along with the souls of his friends meanwhile the pharaoh and kaiba talk about events that happened in the previous episode then pharaoh and priest seto ride back to the palace and attempt to stop zorc soon afterwards shada intercept a lightning bolt meant for the pharaoh sent by zorc which kills shada

the pharaoh summons the three egyptian gods to combat zorc meanwhile at the tabletop in the shadow realm yami bakura claims that soon hell return to his original form and then he leaves the table to join with his 5000-year old counterpart which is zorc at the same time he sends the present-day pharaoh to the battlefield to reunite his past self and the other part of his soul meanwhile zorc defeats the three egyptian gods by covering the sun wiping their strength out as they get their power from the sun zorc then turns the egyptian gods into motionless statues of stone  
mana takes the pharaoh back to the palace while seto summons blue-eyes white dragon to combat zorc blue-eyes white dragon stops the solar eclipse but is defeated by zorc which turns both priest seto and the millennium rod to stone this sends priest setos soul to the shadow realm kaiba takes over and summons blue-eyes ultimate dragon which is equal to power of zorc meanwhile yugi successfully defeats yami bakura with gandora the dragon of destruction but then this allows the spirit of yami bakura to fully reunite with his original body zorc itself which earlier yami bakura had told the pharaoh that both he and zorc were one and the same the pharaoh becomes black luster soldier and fuses with blue-eyes ultimate dragon becoming master of dragon knight but the master of dragon knight is destroyed by its own attack during the battle against zorc and the pharaoh is seemingly defeated but yugi and his friends fly to him  
the pharaoh continues his battle between zorc in the memory world yugi joey and others summon monsters such as the dark magician to help the pharaoh the ancient characters cannot be read but yugi is going to reveal the pharaohs true name tea then remembers the cartouche pendant and passes it to the pharaoh the pharaoh regained his true name atem the keyword which allowed him to summon the three egyptian gods and fuse them together to form the creator of light horakhty horakhty is a level 12 warrior-type divine-god attribute monster with infinite attack and defense points the pharaoh then attacks zorc directly with horakhtys shining light attack which results in zorc being destroyed forever later the pharaoh entrusts the millennium items to priest seto his soul was released from the shadow realm and makes him the next pharaoh of egypt then pharaoh atems body dissolves since his role in the past was over even as priest seto promises to rule egypt justly afterwards atem and his friends leave the memory world of the past

yugi is successful in defeating the egyptian gods however atem is not worried at all atem admits that he knew that yugi would defeat the egyptian gods now the real duel begins between yugi and atem now yugi must face his most trusted creature the dark magician if he wants to help atem note when this aired in the us the ending said to be concluded instead of to be continued thus signifying the end of the series

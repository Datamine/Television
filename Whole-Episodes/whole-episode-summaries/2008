the episode starts by showing suman and two other exorcists of general zokalos team being attacked and killed by tyki mikk however suman was revealed to be still alive when suman awoke he was turned into a monster on the other side after the ships preparations are completed it begins to set sail lenalee saw that allens left hand was flaking becoming worried of allen in the distant horizon allens left eye picks up legions of both level 1s and 2s approaching the ship realizing a massive attack the exorcists prepare for battle however they soon discover that they are not the intended target one of the level 2 akuma separates allen from the ship lenalee saves him and followed him which leads them straight towards the akumas intended target allen and lenalee saw a giant white object similar to a torso which was attacked by many akuma  
recognizing the enormous and uncontrollable white object as fellow exorcist and good friend suman dark a horrified lenalee wonders how he became a togaochi fallen one the legions of akuma continue to assault the huge suman but fail allen and lenalee desperately try to discover how to stop sumans innocence from insanity and try to save him while they tried to pulled suman out a girl is in the hole which suman is in allen pulls her out which leads him into the hole while allen is inside he discovered the truth suman had made a deal with tyki allen realised that sumans innocence is slowly killing suman because of his betrayal  
the fallen one continues to destroy the nearby town allen attempts to stop suman from destroying a nearby village by increasing his innocences synchro rate to its maximum power meanwhile lenalee learns the truth of a fallen and sumans fate from komui that he could not be saved and that he will die she also learned that suman had betrayed the order and god back to allen his left arm stopped activating and broke causing him to have intense pain  
the attack of the akuma on the ship continues and suman continues to destroy the town the huge body of suman begins to deteriorate and allen wastes no time activating his innocence but unfortunately his arm begins to grow in intense pain as he tries to remove sumans innocence miraculously allen manages to get suman and his innocence out of the body then allen and suman fell to the ground unfortunately when allen wakes up he realizes that suman cannot move or respond his body is still alive but his mind is dead allen holds on to sumans innocence in his hand thankful still that hes at least alive when suddenly a slit opens from sumans head and strange black butterflies come flying out and a noah appears  
after watching suman crumble away in front of him allen meets the sadistic noah tyki mikk whose ability besides controlling the devilish butterflies known as tease is to pass through absolutely anything at will he rips off allens left arm and tears a hole in allens heart and destroys his innocence despite allens constant screaming to halt his actions knowing that he is near his final moments of life allen orders timcanpy to escape with sumans innocence timcanpy reluctantly does so as tyki draws closer to the innocence afterwards tyki with the help of his list keeper cell roron discovers allen is on his death list he then orders a tease to tear a hole through allens heart killing him slowly  
lavi and lenalee travel through the air with lavis hammer they saw timcanpy being attacked by akuma after saving timcanpy from the remaining akuma lavi and lenalee follow tim back to the bamboo forest but find that allen is not there anymore tim shows lavi and lenalee the memories of what happened there causing great distraught to both exorcists when they return to the port a man from the asian branch named wong explains that allen was found and is being held at their headquarters in so doing suggesting that allen is dead and that the exorcists are to continue their journey to japan without allen but arriving as his replacement is miranda lotto who uses her anti-akuma weapon time record to restore the ships damage thus the exorcists finally depart china meanwhile allenstill thinking hes deaddreams a lake lake that reflects the order in ruins with a black moon and red sky and lenalee crying alone with what appears to be allens corpse only to awaken in the asian branch alive  
allen finally opens his eyes and wonders how he is alive he discovers from asian headquarters chief bak chan that it is his own innocence which although was destroyed lingered on as a cloud of particles and actually filled the hole of his damaged heart saving his life determined to rejoin his companions get to edo and fulfill his promise to mana allen vows to restore his innocence at all costs however he discovers it will not be as easy as he thinks also allen meets wong who is baks assistant fou who is the guardian of the asian headquarters and three division workers rikei shifu and lou fa  
still unable to restore his innocence by himself allen begins his special training with fou doing battle with her while constantly trying to activate his innocence to fight meanwhile general cloudnyne and general winters zokalo return to the black order upon news of the deaths of their exorcist units  
back on the ship en route to edo lenalee finally decides to accept the fact that allen had to be left behind and she puts on her new exorcist uniform however the ship is attacked by eshii a powerful level 3 akuma who was once a japanese painter which explains why he uses the word title before every attack lavi and bookman fiercely fight against eshii but is no match for him resulting in bookman getting a serious injury only saved temporarily by mirandas power realizing that everyone is in serious danger lenalee leaves the ship to confront eshii alone  
lenalee and eshii continue to fight fiercely in the air while the ship comes under attack from akuma hiding up in the clouds many crewmen are struck by the blasts and killed only to be revived temporarily by mirandas innocence lavi tries to determine how they can fight an enemy that they cannot see meanwhile lenalee and eshiis battle reaches the ocean surface where eshii reveals its true ability he uses its dark matter to create chains around lenalee and the ship increasing the gravity around them and dragging them underwater lenalee struggles to stay afloat but eshii pushes her down and she disappears into the ocean depths  
lenalee floating in darkness remembers allen and what she said to him concerning her view of the world afterwards she pushes herself and her innocence to the limits and even exceeds them defeating eshii in the process and disappearing once again  
the sailors and exorcists on board the ship are trying to protect it from other akuma after finally defeating them they now wait for lenalees return anxiously but lavi could not wait and he uses his hammer to find lenalee suddenly a yellow akuma appears holding lenalee in a crystal-like shield  
lavi leaves the ship to search for lenalee he eventually finds her encased in her innocence which crystallized in order to protect her the innocence is in turn supported by chomesuke a level 2 akuma that was converted by cross marian with chomesukes help lavi brings lenalee back to the ship when the crystal melts she is unable to walk chomesuke delivers a warning from cross and explains the dire situation in japan nevertheless the group decides to push forward since they are pressed for time the exorcists along with three surviving sailors board a lifeboat that chomesuke propels miranda deactivates her innocence causing the ship and its crew to revert to real time with anita mahoja and the people on board disappear into the sea  
the five exorcists and three surviving sailors finally arrive in japan but they are in bad shape chomesuke whose real name is sachiko tells them that japan has long been under the earls control on the way to edo the group witnesses one of chomesukes friends being killed and eaten by three level 3 akuma chomesuke is captured by one of them who prove to be more than a match for both lavi and krory however lavi cleverly attracts the attention of the other two level 3s and the three akuma begin fighting amongst each other over who will kill the exorcists who seize their chance to escape  
allen trains endlessly trying to reactivate his innocence but he makes little progress frustrated he begins to try harder as he desperately wants to return to his friends and to fight the akuma alongside them fou disguises herself as lou fa and talks with allen reminding him that he fights not for the sake of fighting but for something precious to him allen remembers that he is fighting for the sake of his friends meanwhile tyki mikk checks with the earl to see if the cell roron is correct about allens existence he then sends a level 3 akuma and a tease to china to kill allen  
a level 3 akuma heads for china to kill allen lenalee and the others head towards edo and are ambushed by the level 3 akuma that they saw on the shore they manage to evade them for a while but eventually they are surrounded before they can do anything however the earl summons all akuma to edo so they leave without doing anything chomesuke also parts with the group because the earls order is too strong for her to resist but she manages to tell them that the earl is at the edo castle meanwhile while training with fou in the asian branch allens eye activates the earl orders the akuma to kill general cross and general tiedoll and dispatches the noah clan lavi and the exorcists appear and challenge them in order to protect the generals tyki mikk recognizes them and challenges lavi who knows him only as the noah that killed allen tyki tells them that allen is still alive but he had sent a level 3 akuma to kill him  
allen slowly improves his fighting technique but he still cannot cause his innocence to materialize though it does respond to the training allen focuses deeply on returning to his friends causing his innocence to show high energy readings however just as the energy readings peak allens left eye activates and searches for an unknown target which causes allen great pain and alarms the scientists allen describes a growing sense that an akuma is calling him and he tries to continue training despite the immense pain however at that point the pain spikes and allen faints as they take a break bak and the apprentices contemplate allens fate suddenly fou senses something strange as tyki mikks level 3 assassin approaches and she tells bak to hide allen the akuma blows a hole through fou breaking her barrier the branch alarm goes off and everyone panics allen having come to runs into the apprentices then comes face to face with the level 3 allens left eye immediately activates and omits a strange sensation fou tells allen to run as his life is the top priority but allen refuses at that moment the akuma attacks allen with its dark matter piercing through his chest  
tykis level 3 akuma assassin hits allen with its dark matter that partially breaks down his molecular structure making his body highly unstable meanwhile as the asian branch enters lockdown bak awakens the guardian deity with a blood seal on his hand trapping the akuma in a web of light the group then retreats with bak carrying a wounded fou and rikei carrying an unstable allen bak leads them to a large room which he attempts to seal with the guardian deity however before he can finish the akuma catches up with them fou decides to sacrifice herself in order to allow allen and the others get to safety she takes the form of allen and enters the passage to face the akuma as bak seals the section away allen who is deeply upset by fous sacrifice tries to force bak to unseal the doorway even threatening to expose baks secret stalking of lenalee when bak still refuses allen expresses his realization that he fights for the sake of both humans and akuma then black blood drips from his left eye instead of tears his innocence manifests itself around him and he warps to the door which bak finally unseals allen enters the room just as fou is about to be killed allen jumps onto the akumas back and injures it with his right hand  
allen engages the level 3 akuma in battle allen speaks to the soul trapped within the akuma and learns that this soul was the one that had previously been calling out to him the soul asks allen to save him and allen consents however because his bodys composition is unstable due to the akumas prior attack allen literally begins to fade during the fight when allen is almost atomized the akuma turns on bak and fou partially disintegrating their bodies too enraged allen finally decides that he will save humans with his right hand and akuma with his left hand this reactivates his innocence and he destroys the level 3 his new innocence gives him a long black arm with razor sharp talons for fingers he also acquires a white cowl that shoots web-like projectiles and is fitted with a mask before the akuma dies he tells allen of the gathering of the noah the level 3 akuma and the exorcists in edo  
after allen recovers his left arm he reflects on his old innocence while many tests are done on the ark and a few on his new innocence the tests show that his innocence has completely synchronized with his body bak and allen decide on a new name for allens newly evolved innocence gods clown also known as crown clown he is then given a new exorcist coat by wong and he bids farewell to the asian branch preparing to leave and board the ark bak gives allen a wireless communicator in a form of a gold earring which allows him to talk to komui lou fa rikei and shifu return allens deck of cards and allen prepares to head off to edo via noahs ark the episode ends with lavi preparing to engage in battle with tyki mikk  
the battle between the exorcists and the noah continues while lavi fights tyki the earl combines the level 3 akuma into one giant akuma and attacks the exorcists meanwhile lavi attacks tyki with a new move a combination of the fire and heaven seals the exorcists attack the combined akuma but their attacks have little effect the combined akuma uses its evil star gita attack and destroys much of the battlefield chomesuke sacrifices herself to enable lavi krory and bookman to attack the combined akumas head its weak point although they succeed in knocking it down the akuma manages to get back up again and severely injures them meanwhile allen enters the ark and is surprised to find that it is a lovely place filled with white buildings just like any other country when he expresses his concern for his friends komui cheers him up by telling him to think about happy thoughts kanda marie and general tiedoll arrive in edo overlooking the scene of the battle between the exorcists and the akuma  
the fight between lavi and tyki continues while lavi is repeatedly beaten down by tyki bookman and krory continue their assault on the combined akuma but their attacks continue to fail meanwhile miranda can no longer maintain her innocences barrier over the storage room giving tyki the opportunity to capture lenalee chaoji and his comrades attempt to help her but their efforts are in vain just as tyki is about to deal them the killing blow kanda intervenes and begins a fight with tyki with lavis help he manages to save lenalee tyki prepares to counterattack but he retreats when ordered to by the millennium earl marie uses his noel organons ability to paralyze one of the combined akuma kanda then reveals mugens second illusion nigentou and destroys the akuma in one slash however before the exorcists can relax the earl fires off a black orb of energy that grows larger and larger engulfing edo in the process  
the earls black orb of energy completely destroys edo the exorcists are left in various conditions though general cross group is more severely wounded lenalee however is protected by her innocence which once again encases her in a crystal-like form this form catches the earls interest and he sends tyki skin and the combined akuma to obtain her innocence kanda fights tyki lavi and marie confront skin and general tiedoll confronts the combined akuma however with all the exorcists doing battle with the noah lenalee is left unguarded giving the earl a chance to obtain her innocence himself just as he is about to kill lenalee a white arm stops him the arks gate is shown open leading directly to lenalee where allen and the earl meet face to face once again  
the battle in edo continues after greeting the earl allen vows to protect lenalee the earl retaliates and thus begins fighting allen during the fight the earl reveals some of his hidden abilities by turning lero into a sword eventually allen hits the earl with a cross grave attack but the earl seems unaffected the earl laughs and assures allen that they will continue their fight another time and he fires a purple orb of energy which causes a massive explosion when the smoke clears the earl tyki and skin are gone and the exorcists are in confusion inside the ark the earl reveals to tyki that both allen and his innocence are still alive in edo the exorcists seize their chance to heal and regroup despite general tiedolls warning of the upcoming dangers general cross group decides to keep moving forward lenalee awakens and thanks allen for trying so hard to save suman a pentacle suddenly appears on the ground and lenalee is kidnapped by lero and disappears  
lero kidnaps lenalee who is sucked into a portal seeing lenalee disappear allen reaches into the portal and is pulled in as well lavi kanda krory and chaoji follow suit soon after those who are left behind look to the sky and see a strange object in the sky general tiedoll and bookman realize that the object is the infamous noahs ark they are then attacked by a horde of combined akuma marie attacks with noel organon while tiedoll attacks with art miranda who is still tired from the previous encounters tells bookman that everyones time is still inside her innocence but any new injuries that they receive will not heal inside the ark allen and his friends see a projection of the earl who tells them that they will be deleted along with the ark in three hours the exorcists raced to find the exit that allen had previously used tyki appears and tells them that there is an exit situated at the arks highest point the top of a tower allen realizes that tyki is the noah that destroyed his innocence tyki gives them a key to roads exit door and leaves the room that the exorcists entered is occupied by the noah skin boric kanda who recognizes skin as the noah targeting general tiedoll tells the others to go ahead and prepares to challenge skin by himself  
kanda decides to fight the noah skin bolic and tells the others to go ahead they refuse and insist on staying with kanda until he finally attacks them in fury they go ahead after lenalee makes kanda promise to follow them nonetheless they worry because they know that the room will be destroyed once it finishes downloading now alone kanda fights skin one-on-one tyki mikk watches them as well as the other exorcists in a room with road skin transforms and starts battling kanda in edo marie and tiedoll continue to fight the combined akuma  
kanda superior in speed and skin superior in power fight to an apparent stalemate skin reflects on his past while barraging kanda with blasts of lightning kanda responds by using his nigentou the room shakes signaling that it will collapse soon kanda then activates his kinki sangenshiki taboo three illusions as he uses this move which drains part of his life kanda remembers a conversation that he had with komui regarding the duration of his life as well as a lotus blossom that symbolizes the amount of time that he has left suddenly chains representing skins dark energy materialize connecting kanda to skin skin uses these to throw kanda around telling him that the noah can never die finally kanda unleashes a final attack as skin falls kanda tells him that anyone can die as long as they remain mortal sure of his victory kanda heads for the exit however as he approaches it skin reawakens and prepares for his final attack  
believing he defeated skin kanda walks to the exit of the room but the numbness in his left hand and knee hinder him in addition too much of his life was consumed in the battle with skin as he is about to lose consciousness skins eyes start to bleed skin remembers three years ago when he went to see a priest who told him about noahs remembering the pain that the innocence caused his ancestors the noah revives to fight kanda once more draining more of his life kanda restores mugen momentarily and destroys him but the exit crumbles before he can leave as the room crumbles kanda thinks of his comrades and of the lotus blossom representing the remainder of his life wilting and he smiles before he disappears the room then completely collapses in edo miranda notices that someones time has vanished  
as skin boric dies the noah within the others begin to cry they then find out that general cross had escaped from the noah twins jasdero and david once again and left them with the debts road notices that allens name is on the bills while the group continues walking down the corridor the twins set several traps which involve liquor bottles and gambling allen manages to beat these challenges through his knowledge of past experiences with general cross eventually they come face to face with jasdero and david the fight begins with the twins using their guns to fire cross bills at allen before firing a bigger bullet  
the exorcists begin fighting the twins jasdero and david the twins fire several kinds of bullets blue freezes everything it touches red ball of fire and white nulls the effect of their own power the twins want allen to pay the debts general cross tricked them into paying which allen claims that they are nothing compared to those that he had soon after the twins fire a purple bullet covering the eyes of the exorcists causing them to hallucinate the twins hide from sight and allen loses roads key in a sea of illusionary copies summoned by the twins ability  
no longer visible to the group jasdero and david attack after allen fails to force them out of hiding the twins fire a new bullet the green bomb enclosing allen in an airless jelly-like blob lavi helps and reveals as he is bookmans successor he can identify the key as he searches for the key krory also reveals that he can find the twins and directs allen in successfully catching them to get out of their hold the twins release a mud-monster called jasdevis hatred on allen and krory devouring them whole the twins then take lenalee and use her as a shield angering allen who breaks free only to be kept busy by an illusionary earl with all the strength of the real one lero reveals that the twins power is materialization where when they are thinking the same thing they make it real lavi finds the key the masks and illusions disappear and the twins are visible once again they become angered from being called kids and annoyances so they merge and reveal their true form jasdevi the strongest body ever imagined  
in their combined form jasdevi has become exponentially stronger krory fights jasdevi one-on-one to allow the others time to escape when krory drinks one of his three bottles of chomesukes blood he is able to fight almost on par with jasdevi jasdevi angers him by casually calling him a vampire and a monster it reminds him of his lost love the only one allowed to call him vampire fueled by his anger krory drinks a second bottle of blood but the fight has left him too weak to break down the poison within his blood he grows weaker but tries to avoid drinking the last bottle as the fight wears on he decides that he must drink the last bottle but jasdevi takes it from him and drinks it himself with krory greatly weakened jasdevi is able to enclose him inside an iron maiden  
after krorys defeat jasdevi moves onward toward allen and the others meanwhile the dying krory encounters his lost love eliade who tells him that by dying hell lose those humans who considered him a friend more determined than ever krorys blood leaves his body and attacks jasdevi in a form created by his innocence called bloody krory this weakens jasdevi a lot and after one final clash jasdevi de-materializes into jasdero and david causing them to stop and rest ultimately falling through the door and disappearing after the room krory is in collapses allen and the rest continue their walk through the ark and come to the final room at the top of the tower where road and tyki await upon arriving at the top allen is tackled by road camelot the dreams of noah and is kissed by her there they discover that the tower is the only building left intact in the ark  
with only the tower left standing on the ark the group is now trapped inside with two noahs lenalee and lavi are shocked to learn that allens innocence has literally become part of his heart this leads lavi to speculate allen in addition to lenalee may be the heart soon after allen and tyki face off once again meanwhile road traps lenalee and chaoji and sends lavis mind and spirit to another dimension where he has to confront himself and road promised that if he survives she would release their trapped comrades  
allens battle with tyki mikk and lavis struggle with roads dream continue tyki is determined to crush allens innocence once again then allen remembers komui saying that innocence is the weakness of noah and vice versa tyki attacked allen with a strong power damaging allens innocence but it healed allen pushes his innocence to injure tykis noah within him thus tyki uses his ability to create a vacuum in the atmosphere around allen disabling his ability to breathe and suffocating him as tyki enters the vacuum to finish off allen he notices that allen is still conscious allen attempts to activate his innocence with stronger synchronization and power but tyki drives his hand into allens heart and as he is about to crush it allens body begins glowing meanwhile in the hq hevlaska is experiencing pain and chanting that a new general is coming komui and reever both suggest that it is allen back at the ark allen pushes tyki away and his forearm is transformed into a sword handle as he pulls it out he mentions that the critical point has been broken the episode ends with tyki shocked and allen wielding the sword with his left arm gone  
after exceeding critical point allens power and synch-rate with his innocence has exponentially increased his new sword which resembles the earls scares the noah upon first sight of its power as allen escapes from tykis vacuum lenalee and chaoji attempt to escape roads cell but hurt themselves in the process meanwhile tyki defends against allens innocence and remembers events from his white side and his black side allen finally breaks through the defenses and cuts him thinking he should be dead tyki and the others are confused to see he has suffered no apparent damage yet felt pain allen reveals purpose to save the human or white side of tyki mikk he pierces crown clown through tyki stigmata began forming where the cut should be and tyki begins to feel the pain of the noah inside him dying as road watches in horror allen exorcise the noah from tyki and the noahs gray skin and forehead stigmata fade away but chaoji is suddenly stabbed by roads candles after watching her family member exorcised road surrounded them with candle stakes and swore her revenge deciding to destroy lavis mind trapped within her meanwhile lavi realizes that his illusionary environment can still hurt him surrounded by his dead allies come back to life lavi prepares to attack the illusions  
in roads dream world lavi cuts down his comrades as he tries to ignore their pleads his other self looks on and lectures lavi who is soon defeated by his illusionary friends road reveals lavi was never injured but went into shock because he believed his friends stabbed him she releases lavi now controlled by his bookman heart and orders allen to kill him or lenalee and chaoji will die by her candles but allen refuses and instead stabs road but she is uninjured as it is not her true body allen is engulfed in flames but realizes that the heat is not affecting him the candles surrounding lenalee and chaoji begin to melt instead back in control of his body lavi burns himself and engulfs road in flame she still seems uninjured however until a blade pierces her body back in the dream world lavi realizes that allen in roads dream is the true road and succeeds in damaging her  
after damaging road in the dream world lavi starts to fade away however the other lavi realizes he is the exorcists real mind and returns to his body screaming lavis name allen manages to save him and the fire seal turns into stone road breaks out of the stone and is unable to move lenalee starts to believe that allen and lavi are gone but they also emerge from a pile of stone road starts to laugh hysterically until she bursts into smoke soon after the room starts to crumble when they reach the exit allen decides to save tyki but is pulled down to the floor below after the dust clears it seems something is wrong with tyki who has transformed into something terrifying  
the transformed tyki is too fast and too powerful for allen and lavi and with the door destroyed there is no way out of the ark despite that there is little hope the exorcists fight back when the tower crumbles chaoji reacts to an innocence saving his and lenalees life for the while the fight continues as allen vows to fight until his life ends meanwhile strange beings guard a large round object and seem to be defeated by one of their own  
tyki is gaining momentum while allen and lavi are weakening as allen falls through a hole he is saved by a stranger who turns out to be his master general cross marian cross singlehandedly defeats tyki with grave of maria and judgment just as he is landing the final blow the millenium earl interrupts the ark crumbles with lavi and chaoji falling into the abyss as the earl and cross face each other  
the earl and general cross share a brief conversation and when the earl mentions all of the exorcists who disappeared allen becomes enraged and attempts to fight the earl despite the fact that he is quite seriously wounded upon seeing allens new innocence the earl comments that it is just like his own sword and after trading a few blows with allen decides to take the unconscious tyki and escape the crumbling ark as allen attempts to follow the earl general cross uses the carte garde ability of his innocence grave of maria and orders allen to stop fighting the earl from his hatred the general then takes both allen and lenalee to the akuma egg plant and orders allen to control the ark and sends him and timcampy into the secret room of the 14th noah where allen faces a dark apparition in the mirror who calls timcampy my timcampy the black ark of the earl is revealed and it seems that all is lost as the original ark disappears but when allen begins to play on the white piano using a mysterious set of symbols projected by timcampy as the music the ark begins to join back together again  
allen managed to control the ark so the ark was repaired with all the exorcists who perished in the ark back to life furthermore the factory egg for creating akuma was half downloaded due to general crosss spell so it does not function chaoji then gains his innocence in the form of two bracelets interlocked as he tried to rescue the exorcists when they fell through a bottomless door a pair of interlocked bracelets attached to his left hand they suddenly realise that general cross who is a womanizer is alone with lenalee they hurry back only to discover the general and lenalee appear to be in a passionate embrace  
allen and all of his comrades return safely to the hq and miranda deactivates her innocence making the injuries the noah inflicted on the exorcists to reappear while the exorcists recover in the hospital of hq bak and other scientists study the arks ability to teleport people anywhere in the world allen goes into the piano room with tim and ponders on how the symbols he and mana created years ago were the song to move the ark elsewhere the earl becomes enraged by the fact that the 14th noah has somehow helped the exorcists obtain the ark and the akuma egg  
komui and bak meet with other branch heads and the four generals and were confronted by special inspector malcolm c levellier and his assistance howard link levellier and link outlined all the events that started in edo and proposed severe punishments for cross because of his unorthodox handling of his mission they also proposed putting allen on trial for heresy because he and cross clearly have some sort of tie with the enemy specifically the fourteenth noah cross was alarmed that leverrier knew about the fourteenth but he was confident that nothing would be turned up in any investigation thus leverrier assigned howard link to supervise allens every movement  
howard link confronts allen in the cafeteria while notifying him that he will be under surveillance after hearing howard talk to allen lenalee talks to her brother to understand the meaning of this she comes in contact with inspector malcolm c and remembers her past when she was traumatized by him the inspector said that the will of the 14th is continued by multiple people and general cross is one of them eventually allen learns that he is suspected of being related to the 14th noah and he is banned from having contact with cross and allen saw the shadow in the piano room again later on it is discovered that the science department of the order somehow removed the akuma egg from the ark to study it the heads of various branches came in and offered to help with the study of the egg as well but they were rejected by johnny then johnny was stabbed by the noah lulubell who was in disguise as one of the black order branch head andrew while hundreds of akuma appeared behind her  
the noah lulubell disguised as branch head andrew nansen and her army of akuma and skulls attack the headquarters lab 5 where the akuma egg is being studied the army injures the entire science department and intending to turn them into skulls tapp is the first to be transformed allen and bookman arrive through the ark just as reever was about to be the second lulubell orders the akuma to hold off the exorcists until she has retrieved the egg throwing allen immediately into battle lenalee and lavi attempt to reach allen but they are stopped by komui and locked into the infirmary lenlee begs komui to let her go so she can see hevlaska and re-synch with her innocence but komui refuses saying he cannot lose her meanwhile allen and bookman still struggle with the endless army of level 3 akuma lulubell opens up a gate and prepares the egg for retrieval  
allen and bookman are still fighting the akuma but lulubell has already secured the akuma egg and opened a gate to the millennium earl with nobody to help them allen and bookman struggle to keep up many of the researchers have already been transformed into skulls as bak and the rest of the survivors attempt to make a talisman outside komui arrives and malcolm criticizes him for being slow and suggesting the worst-case scenario inside lab 5 miranda lotto noise marie and the generals arrive just as the egg is being transferred and allen is kidnapped with surprising efficiency the generals take down the giant akuma take back the egg and rescue allen

a heroic family reaches across the border to give to others—while letting their own house sit unfinished 
twelve years ago maria ruiz and her family of el paso texas committed themselves to feeding the poor across the border in juarez mexico and helping their local community 
it’s inspirational for us to hear that maria and her husband jesus travel across the border every day bringing food clothing and supplies to thousands between them the two work multiple jobs in order to do this work—and in fact maria was recently named one of the “top ten cnn heroes of 2008” for all of her foundation work 
we come to see that there has been a trade-off for all of this dedicated work to others—the ruiz family home sits unfinished the construction that began over 12 years ago was stopped dead for the charitable work—as all resources and family efforts have been directed to helping others instead as a result we’re shocked to see the house tilting in on itself the exposed plywood floors cracks in floors and walls and to top it all off the house lacks heat 
additionally the food bank work has taken over the house—but the living room is overflowing due to lack of storage and the kitchen itself is woefully inadequate 
due to the ruiz family’s spirit thousands of starving people have been able to eat now it’s up to ty the designers and hundreds of blue-shirted volunteers to help give back to them tony little “america’s personal trainer” also stops in to help lend a hand to this project

both of their parents are strong community supporters—their father chuck works for homeland security while terri their mother has worked all her life in global relief—organizing search and rescue dog services for worldwide disaster additionally you discover that terri has founded “artful hearts” a group which helps improve the lives of sick children by painting murals in clinics and hospitals trying to bring cheer to those undergoing treatments we’re surprised to find that terri has also found the time to be a patient advocate for the immune deficiency foundation and has met with senators to influence laws governing medications 
this family has given so much to their community and yet struggled with their own home we see the details of how their house was unknowingly in poor condition when they first bought it and through a series of floods severe water damage set in we find it heartbreaking to hear that structural engineers had advised them to gut the house and rebuild—thankfully ty and the designers have arrived to give a lending hand 
however in 2011 it was discovered that terri cerda has münchausen syndrome by proxy and that molly and maggie cerda are totally healthy and have no health problems whatsoever child protective services in oregon became involved and testified in court against terri cerda to have her daughters taken away from her 
 
through the power of books one man aims to spark the imagination of the local kids in his community but we discover that he and his own boys are residing in appalling conditions 
our special two-part season finale takes us to indianapolis indiana where we meet another everyday hero bernard mcfarland whose deteriorating house will be rebuilt from the ground up—with help from ty and the gang and a strong cast of blue-shirted volunteers 
we learn that starting when he was young librarian bernard learned the power of books and the weight of words although he grew up poor and overcame obstacles that we can’t begin to imagine he graduated from college joined the military and later returned home to his three sons 
back in indianapolis bernard was determined not to accept the troubled community around him his mission to reduce both the rising violence in the neighborhood and the number of kids dropping out of school we discover that he founded pack house 2000 a program dedicated to expanding dreams of youngsters by forming reading groups and organizing field trips to libraries museums and cultural events throughout the city all of this we learn he managed to make happen with very limited resources 
we see throughout the episode that bernard is an important part of his community but has been unable to take care of his own home we shudder at seeing the holes throughout the ceilings walls and floors the water damage in the sub-flooring and the rusting pipes corroded wiring and crumbling drywall and our hearts can’t help but to go out to his three boys who all share one room 
we don’t know about you but our spirits sure soar as we watch designer paul dimeo shoot hoops with the indiana pacers who make a special donation and as we see this special house come together for an inspiring father who has helped so many realize their own dreams

the 15 new chefs arrived at los angeles international airport and were driven to hells kitchen unaware that chef ramsay was accompanying them in a disguise when they arrived at hells kitchen they met jean-philippe and each took turns impersonating chef ramsay who then removed his mask and revealed himself to the chefs 
louross nominated bobby and dominic while the men all blamed bobby for the failure of the service chef ramsay eliminated dominic for his complete lack of professional experience and terrible performance 
 
the men were transported via rolls royces and bentleys to a superyacht where they enjoyed dinner with chef ramsay and jean-philippe the women had to prepare the seafood for the next nights service during the punishment tension arose between corey jen and by extension christina when jen complained about the fillet while christina tried to say it was all of their faults which led corey to believe jens personality was to blame others when things dont go her way 
while the other women had been expecting the nominees to be sharon and rosann corey instead nominated christina and jen freely admitting that she disliked them personally and saw them as a threat after watching christina burst in to tears and jens extremely long plea about what she does in prep ramsay announced that he wouldnt give his restaurant to someone he had no faith in and eliminated sharon for her second terrible service in a row and said he had a conscience and whilst he appreciated coreys strategy he couldnt keep sharon in the end 
 
the women visited the saddle ranch chop house a western-themed restaurant on the sunset strip where they unintentionally met restaurant regular aaron song a former contestant from the shows third season the men were transported to a field in the country to pick peppers and during the punishment ben tossed peppers at craig while jason decided not to work as much as the rest of the group 
chef ramsay had petrozza and christina both best of the worst for their teams nominate a person from their team for elimination they even stood away from their team mates in front of the winning teams table during the elimination ceremony the others were hoping christina would get revenge on corey for nominating her unexpectedly petrozza while feeling craig had been the worst performer of the night and felt the team would benefit from him being eliminated nominated jason christina nominated vanessa chef ramsay warned vanessa to improve in the next service and eliminated jason for consistently being a terrible performer and nearly quitting the show earlier in the episode 
 
the women were taken via a hummer limousine to the pacific park amusement park at the santa monica pier the men prepared the nights service for both teams while ben unwittingly volunteered to clean up after the animals in the petting zoo set up outside for family night 
after service finished vanessa returned to the dorms and revealed that she had suffered a second-degree burn and was unsure if she could continue in the competition bobby nominated craig and matt feeling that they were the main cause of the teams loss chef ramsay also called out ben for an incident in service where he congratulated the other men despite the blue team being four tables behind the red team though ramsay accused ben of treating the competition like a joke and matt of being the worst performer of the night he ultimately eliminated craig for his repeated mistakes and terrible attitude 
 
before leaving the kitchen to take the women on their reward chef ramsay gave the men a pep talk citing that they had talent and that the only thing missing from was teamwork the women were taken by helicopter to the square one restaurant in santa barbara california home of the 90 burger and their truffle fries the men prepared both kitchens for the following nights service &amp are given extremely thin dry burgers for lunch 
louross acknowledged that he had been the weakest member of the mens team and nominated himself while the women initially decided on rosann however jen who considered herself the leader of the red team and felt that christina was standing in her way back stabbed her &amp persuaded the other women to change their votes to christina ramsay was very shocked by christinas nomination and went on to briefly interrogate the red team about their decision he even asked jen if she was threatened by her intelligence which jen said no &amp felt she decided her faith which lead to a berating of ramsay in the end he decided vanessa would be the only one going home and saying that it was his gift to both teams for completing a full dinner service thus nobody else would be sent home 
 
the blue instantly decided on matt while on the red team corey jen and rosann had agreed before the service to nominate shayna in case the team were asked for any nominees ramsay asked ben &amp christina for their teams nominees who were matt &amp shayna chef ramsay called forward matt and shayna but also called out rosann as well initially it appeared as though ramsay would eliminate matt but matt asked to be put on the red team claiming that ben was the weakest player on the blue team and would be exposed as such to the shock of the other contestants chef ramsay accepted his request and sent him back in line shayna was eliminated as chef ramsay felt she that while she hadnt been a bad performer she was too slow and had never especially impressed him however rosann was warned that she was on her last chance 
 
the red team spent the day at the patio which was converted into a spa the blue team cleaned the kitchen and the dorms in addition ben was called to serve iced tea to the red team 
in the dorms after service ben tried to manipulate the others in to nominating themselves in order to secure his safety from elimination &amp then tried to persuade bobby &amp petrozza in to nominating louross but it backfired ben &amp louross nominated each other bobby nominated petrozza however petrozza didnt nominate any of his team-mates and instead nominated himself saying that the other three men worked too hard chef ramsay complimented petrozza on his gracious attitude and maturity and seeing through the bens plan eliminated him for his consistently bad performances laid back attitude and constant refusal to own up to his mistakes 
 
the red team attended a photo shoot and interview for in touch weekly magazine the blue team spent the day doing laundry by hand jen raged at louross throughout the punishment saying that he should have just lied and said that the missing ingredient was part of the sauce but louross said that there was no way a chef of ramsays experience would ever have fallen for such a ploy 
corey was chosen the best of the worst and had to select two contestants for elimination and selected rosann and matt chef ramsay chose christina to join matt and rosann as nominees and he then told rosann to go back in line however ramsay had second thoughts and eliminated rosann feeling she made too many rookie mistakes &amp her constant disorganisation during service 
 
the red team on their third consecutive win went to the beach with chef ramsay and jean-philippe where they learned how to surf the blue team spent the day cleaning the restaurants exterior the flaming hells kitchen sign and the red carpet which the red team trod upon when they returned from the beach 
petrozza was declared the best of the worst and had to nominate two members for elimination he selected louross and jen chef ramsay then asked petrozza who he should send home petrozza chose louross and chef ramsay agreed &amp eliminated louross despite jens poor attitude and mistakes on the dessert section ramsay considered louross solely responsible for the blue teams defeat chef ramsay then said that in the next service matt and jen would return to their original teams as he felt their reassignments were not working much to the dismay of the other four 
 
while chef ramsay had previously told jen and matt that they would revert to their original teams in this episode he decided to merge remaining six contestants into a united black team a service earlier than planned previously it had been done when there were five remaining contestants 
jen won an overnight trip to las vegas where she had dinner at the green valley ranch resort and spa with last seasons winner rahman rock harper in a surprise she chose corey to join her the others took several deliveries of food tension rose between matt &amp christina during the punishment as matt strongly disliked christinas bossy attitude whilst christina was irritated at matts laziness during prep matt had gone insane through christinas bossiness which bothered the others 
the team unanimously chose matt to be nominated for his odd behavior and trouble on the meat station followed by christina who was also on the meat station when corey said she should have been chosen based on tonights service chef ramsay agreed and also called her forward christina explained to ramsay that her lack of professional experience when compared to the others should not be used a deciding factor towards eliminating her ultimately chef ramsay told matt to leave due to his numerous bad services &amp terrible attitude through out the night much to the relief of the other contestants &amp stated that matt was just a fraction worse than the remaining chefs 
there once was a boy named matt 
whose kitchen performance fell flat 
he was far from neat 
miserable on meat 
so i kicked him out and thats that 
 
christina spent time with chef ramsay and two other chefs mark peel campanile and ben ford fords filling station learning the tricks of the trade while her teammates cleaned the kitchen 
christina the best contestant of the night nominated jen and bobby for elimination when chef ramsay asked christina who she would like to send home she chose jen however chef ramsay eliminated bobby as ramsay felt he was on a downward spiral &amp hadnt became a leader that ramsay hoped he would emerge as 
 
christina and chef ramsay visited the lisa kline boutique in beverly hills where christina spent over 1000 on new clothing the rest got to clean up the dining room and polish silverware for that evenings service 
the final four decided to vote on who should be nominated each person would write down two names but they could not vote for the same person twice despite this jen still predictably voted twice for christina anyways messing up the vote christina corey and petrozza plotted to get her out and decided to put corey on the block at the elimination chef ramsay told corey to say goodbye  to jen while he still considered her a talented cook ramsay had become fed up her inability to work with others and refusal to improve her attitude 
 
each contestant had to nominate someone christina and corey nominated each other while petrozza nominated christina making her the second most nominated contestant next to virginia from season 2 chef ramsay named petrozza and then christina to advance to the finals when corey was sent home chef ramsay acknowledged her to be talented &amp praised her for it 
 
petrozza got first choice of the six former contestants who will serve as the cooks for their restaurants both christina and petrozza won a trip to dubai to spend five days at a resort and to dine at one of chef ramsays restaurants while there 
 
during the final hours before service the finishing touches were made on the contestants restaurants each with 13 tables serving 50 customers in the kitchen christina and petrozza briefed the cooks on their menus while chef ramsay inspected the sample dishes and gave christina and petrozza last-minute advice during the preparation time jen however had no interest in helping petrozza win and wanted to make ramsay change his mind on eliminating her &amp crown her the winner she even asked ramsay for a letter of recommendation while matt openly displayed a negative &amp immature attitude with corey strongly advising christina to tell him to get more serious for her own good so christina tried to get matt to pull himself together 
the criteria for deciding a winner were determined by the comments from the customers as well as chef ramsays own observations summoning christina and petrozza to his office chef ramsay gave them his final thoughts then he had them step to a door to their dream christinas door opened making her the fourth winner of hells kitchen and petrozza took his defeat graciously as he was happy to have experienced hells kitchen

in konoha kakashi rests in a hospital while sakura tells tsunade what the deceased akatsuki member sasori told her that he was supposed to meet a spy within orochimarus ranks at the tenchi bridge in ten days time as four days had already passed naruto realizes the need of another teammate and so starting searching konoha for a willing recruit he runs into team 8 but they are unable to help as they are assigned a mission of their own later just as choji agrees to help naruto the two and shikamaru are attacked by sai  
unable to identify sai naruto choji and shikamaru attempt to capture him but sai withdraws concerned that akatsuki might soon come to konoha looking for the nine-tailed fox the village elders confront tsunade they propose to tsunade to keep naruto in konoha and not send him to missions outside the village tsunade declines and promises to protect konoha with her own life if naruto is captured but she is still forced to compromise with the foundations leader danzo shimura in having sai made a member to team kakashi with kakashi in the hospital tsunade temporarily replaces him with anbu member code-named yamato the anbu operative is given the task to keep an eye on sai later naruto and sakura meet their new team members and naruto is immediately angered upon sais appearance  
yamato takes leadership of team kakashi while sai devoid of any human feelings or emotions insults both naruto and sakura while preparing to set off sai receives an envelope from an anbu root shinobi containing secret orders from danzo jiraiya then meets with tsunade and yamato in kakashis hospital room to brief yamato on the nine-tailed fox sealed within naruto detailing the demon foxs cloak and revealing a huge scar on his chest he got from naruto when the boy lost control after he ascended to a four-tailed form finally the new team kakashi sets off on their new mission to capture and intercept the spy in orochimarus subordinates and gather information about sasuke  
team kakashi heads out for the tenchi bridge sakura and naruto come down hard at sai for making fun of their former teammate sasuke seeing the tension in the team yamato decides they need to improve on teamwork and uses the wood style jutsu to create a wooden cage threatening to lock the trio up unless they behave sakura is shocked to see yamato using the secret techniques that only the first hokage was said to possess given an ultimatum between being locked up or spending the night at a hot springs by yamato the team chooses to visit the springs to improve team cohesion despite this fact naruto still despises sai  
sakura sees sai drawing by a river and finds out that he has artistic talent but has never given titles to anything he ever drew naruto and sakura begin to realize the reason behind sais repulsive personality after the hot springs the team heads off to the tenchi bridge to meet with sasoris spy yamato being suspicious of traps suggests to the team to alter their route and go through a forest camping for the night yamato then creates a two story house by again using his wood style jutsu inside the house the team formulates their plan of capturing the spy  
yamato decides to have a mock test for his team to see how everyone coordinates with each other naruto is paired with sai despite his objections and sakura is assigned to support yamato yamato conducts a simulation of the meeting with himself as the spy to gauge naruto and sais abilities and teamwork after naruto makes a mistake sai immobilizes him and goes off alone naruto is angered with sai for not acting as a comrade would but resolves to work together with him to get sasuke back sai then reveals to sakura that he has no emotions and little understanding of them as a part of his training in anbu root  
yamato disguises himself as sasori within hiruko and goes to meet the spy at the tenchi bridge the spy is revealed to be kabuto who spills out the location of orochimarus current hideout before the meeting could finish orochimaru appears and interrupts the two while kabuto initially seems frightened by orochimarus appearance it turned out to be a ruse as he attacks the disguised yamato after telling kabuto that the figure is not sasori orochimaru recognizes yamato as one of the test subjects in his experiments to replicate hashiramas power through blood transfusion of the first hokages dna orochimaru also knows that yamato is not alone as he tells him to call out naruto sakura and sai from their hiding places  
yamato signals naruto sakura and sai to appear on the bridge on seeing naruto orochimaru begins mocking him and compares him to sasuke which causes the nine-tailss chakra to leak from an enraged narutos body and ascends him to a three-tailed form meanwhile yamato remembers jiraiya speaking of the appearance of number of tails on naruto during their training and had specifically warned of narutos four-tailed transformation  
naruto gets more enraged in his three-tailed state and throws kabuto away who inadvertedly knocks sakura out too narutos anger eventually escalates to him destroying the tenchi bridge and he takes to a forest to battle orochimaru sai creates an ink bird and flies beneath the collapsing bridge to the site of naruto and orochimarus battle instead of catching a falling sakura yamato saves her using his wood style jutsu and creates a wood clone to follow sai in the forest narutos ever-increasing aggression causes his blood to mix with the nine-tailss chakra as his chakra cloak envelops him in the form of a four-tailed miniature fox  
naruto in his four-tailed form attacks orochimaru and devastates the surrounding landscape also preventing sai and yamatos wood clone from approaching him the majority of orochimarus attacks prove to be ineffective against naruto but he still manages to keep up with naruto with his regeneration jutsu meanwhile kabuto advances toward sakura and yamato deducing that sasori has died orochimaru finally manages to strike naruto with his kusanagi sword even though he fails to pierce the sword through him seeing naruto in his four-tailed state sakura is awestruck and terrified  
kabuto states that narutos current form is a consequence of his desperation to bring back sasuke to konoha sakura begins to cry and tries to approach naruto but is attacked by him yamato erects chakra-suppressing wooden pillars using his wood style to bind naruto before he does any more harm kabuto heals sakura and disappears after reasoning that the konoha ninja are not orochimarus enemies because they are also fighting the akatsuki yamato forcibly returns naruto to his normal state meanwhile sai who was hiding nearby the battlefield the entire time confronts orochimaru on behalf of orders from danzo  
sakura tries to heal naruto but her medical ninjutsu has little effect on his wounds in the forest orochimaru tries to kill sai but it is revealed to be an ink clone the real sai emerges from the ground and gives orochimaru a letter from danzo sai then leaves with orochimaru and kabuto for their hideout with yamatos wood clone on their trail after naruto comes to his senses the team reaches the battlefield spot and picks up sais picture book from what his clone observed yamato infers that danzo seeks to destroy konoha with orochimarus aid  
to confuse and slow down yamatos wood clone kabuto creates a fake corpse resembling sai naruto still recovering from the effects of his four-tailed state is told to stay behind by yamato however naruto tells yamato he is fine and the trio continue to follow sai during their pursuit the team is forced to take a break when sakuras own injuries take their toll on her as she heals herself yamato talks to naruto in solace and tells him that it was he in his four-tailed form who hurt sakura naruto is shocked to know this and condemns his own actions  
yamato tells naruto not to rely on the nine-tails chakra as he is strong enough on his own the konoha team decides to browse sais book to give them some clue about him and they notice that its filled with the story of two boys paths and battles however the pages where the two boys would meet are unfinished meanwhile orochimarus group reach their hideout not realizing that yamatos wood clone had spotted them there sai confronts a shadowed sasuke realizing that this is the man whom naruto and sakura have been searching for  
sai is temporarily trapped in a powerful genjutsu from sasukes sharingan that frightens him after recovering sai tells sasuke that naruto sees him as a brother as told to him by sakura sasuke replies that he has only one brother the one he is going to kill and leaves orochimaru gives the envelope with information from danzo about konohas anbu to kabuto and instructs him to make a bingo book on reaching near orochimarus hideout yamato gives sakura and naruto wooden seeds to ingest which are imbued with his chakra that would enable him to track them down in case they are lost and reveals that he was able to track sai with the same seeds that he had secretly fed sai in the hideout kabuto locks sai in a room and the latter summons a bingo book of the same information in the envelope outside yamato uses a earth style jutsu to open a tunnel into orochimarus hideout and he naruto and sakura travel to sais room undetected  
yamato and his team enter sais room and confront him sai tells them that not only was he to help in konohas destruction but also act as a spy against orochimaru yamato reveals that in anbu root one must murder his own comrades and sever their emotions but sakura returns sais picture book to him remarking that he still has emotions because he treasures it afterwards the team ties up sai once outside naruto informs sai about his bonds of a brother with sasuke and about how far he would go to bring sasuke back  
before yamatos team departs to find sasuke in the hideout kabuto appears in front of them and attacks them before freeing sai however sai wanting to learn more about his own bonds with his deceased brother through narutos bond with sasuke betrays kabuto and aids yamato in his capture a tied up kabuto gives a vague description of sasukes location to the team thinking that orochimaru would just kill them either way leaving yamatos wood clone to watch over kabuto yamato and his team enter orochimarus hideout and they split up to find sasuke naruto and sai heading one way with sakura and yamato to another  
as the konoha team continues their search for sasuke naruto suddenly collapses due to exhaustion from his previous battle with orochimaru as naruto wakes up sai remembers what he wanted to draw in the middle pages of his picture book him and his brother smiling an action which sai mirrors as sai talks about his bonds orochimaru suddenly appears and attacks them sakura and yamato come to narutos aid while sai goes alone to continue the search just as sai finds sasuke with his ink rats yamato finds sais bingo book and realizes sais actual mission upon finding sasuke listed as a target for assassination  
yamato suggests that sais true objective is to kill sasuke who according to his master danzo is a threat to konoha sai enters sasukes room and wakes him up but instead of following his orders and killing sasuke sai reveals that he wants to preserve naruto and sasukes bonds sasuke retaliates by causing a giant explosion in his room which attracts sakura naruto and yamatos attention as naruto and sakura meet with their former friend sai declares that he is discarding his mission orders and now wishes to aid naruto in bringing sasuke back to konoha  
with his skills immensely improved over the years sasuke begins to attack naruto but sai intervenes sasuke keeps the two at bay with his chidori current sakura decides to charge at sasuke but yamato jumps in front of her only to wind up being stabbed by sasukes chidori-infused katana deep within his conscious remembering what yamato told him naruto attempts to resist the nine-tailss goading before the fox attempts to goad naruto to using its power however sasuke uses his sharingan to enter narutos mind and stop him from reaching the nine tails with sasuke meeting him for the first time the nine tails compares sasukes chakra to that of madara uchiha before being totally suppressed by the young uchiha as his chakra dissipates the nine-tails warns sasuke not to kill naruto

kakashi is released from the hospital and begins narutos training program naruto learns that he has wind-style chakra yamato helps by setting up the training field with his special jutsu naruto also learns that he can use his multi shadow clone jutsu to speed up his training since whatever the clones learn the original user learns upon the clones dispersal naruto and his mass of clones each take a leaf and attempt to slice it in half with wind chakra as the first step to creating his new jutsu  
naruto and his clones continue to work on chakra nature manipulation by slicing leaves after some struggling naruto approaches asuma who is also a wind type for advice after which naruto is subsequently able to slice a leaf in half asuma and yamato then head out with their teams on new missions it is revealed that asuma is the third hokages son and that he is in a relationship with kurenai meanwhile on a hill overlooking a burnt village four cloaked figures discuss the awakening of the fire country by eliminating the leaf village

the temple monks explain that the tombs hold the loyal bodyguards of fire countrys feudal lord naruto observes sora sparring with other monks and becomes offended upon realizing he is holding back naruto challenges sora but just as the matter is about to get serious another monk stops him naruto realizes sora is despised by the other monks as he was himself and wishes to befriend him naruto visits sora again and observes him practicing his wind jutsu in earnest hoping to get strong enough to avenge his father they later return to the temple to receive news that another tomb has been robbed  
tsunade suspects that danzou is plotting something and orders an investigation of him team kakashi chiriku and sora notice the coffins moving on their own but fail to intercept them the coffins emerge on a cliff where the leader of the enemy ninja orders his subordinates to deal with their foes the ninjas turn the area into a maze of rocky canyons and pits full of deadly traps the team members are separated from each other and begin facing off against the enemy yamato speculates that the ninja may have orchestrated the theft in order to target someone on his team  
team kakashi begins facing off against the enemy shinobi yamato eludes his opponent fudo by faking his death sora unwilling to look for naruto goes off on his own back in konoha danzo reveals that he is aware that he is being watched by tsunades anbu naruto fights fūka whose kiss is fatal and shows her ability to use earth fire water and lightning jutsus sai manages to escape from his attacker fuen and later saves sakura from an enormous spider becoming injured in the process sora then hits upon the enemy leader furido and it is revealed that he was the groups target

asuma supervises naruto and soras wind chakra training and notices that sora like naruto has very powerful chakra tsunade and yamato learn from chiriku that sora was inadvertently responsible for an incident in which the temple of fire was destroyed later asuma gives sora a claw made from the same materials as his chakra blades it is revealed that asuma killed soras father kazuma who had planned to kill the hokage furido then approaches sora telling him that asuma is responsible for his fathers death and passing him two king pieces from a shogi set for asuma danzo mysteriously disappears naruto approaches a furious sora in the training grounds who easily throws a chakra-powered kunai through a tree and destroys the stone behind it

with konoha in complete darkness the village struggles to defend against the four attackers who have sealed the entire village behind a barrier the entire village is in a state of emergency asuma commanded by tsunade to follow sora and naruto finally catches up to them asuma realizes that the four invaders plan to annihilate the entire village using the lightning powers of the corpses that they stole the revelation shocks sora as asuma leaves to help hold off the attackers he instructs naruto to continue pursuing sora

sora refuses to let furido destroy the village despite his grudge against asuma and the hokage he is beaten up by furido who claims that his father had a similar flaw asuma gets trapped by kitane in a force field of lightning meanwhile yamato and sakura kill their opponents and shikamaru heads to the battlefield with a plan to defeat the zombies just as he puts it into motion however fuens barrier falls and fudos revival technique ends and the zombies turn to dust  
naruto deduces that fukas secret consists of switching bodies to use each corresponding element and that her hair preserves her youth and body naruto damages her hair and it takes a life of its own dispensing the body but naruto finally kills it with a rasengan meanwhile asuma manages to break free of the electric barrier catch up with kitane and defeat him in a short fight realizing that kitane is no more and that his three other companions were killed furido causes the 3 other ninja guardians to disappear but furido has a backup plan sora  
furido releases soras seal and tells him the truth sora is a pseudo-jinchuriki the chakra that had leaked from the nine-tailed fox when it attacked konoha 15 and a half years ago was harvested and implanted into sora just then asuma arrives at the scene with naruto asuma recognizes furido and it is revealed that he is kazuma soras father yamato sakura kiba lee ino choji and shikamaru also turn up enraged sora wants to destroy everything and turns into the three-tailed form of the demon fox however yamato is unable to restrain him because he does not have the first hokages necklace on him  
the chakra of the nine-tails rages out of control within sora preventing naruto and the others from subduing him asuma and kazuma resume their old battle naruto is repeatedly knocked down in his attempts to restrain sora and the chakra seeps into him and transforms him as well yamato is unable to suppress the nine-tails chakra in both jinchūriki being prevented by an unknown outside force soras fourth tail emerges causing the nine-tailss cloak to envelop his body he temporarily gains his own consciousness when he witnesses naruto stab himself in the leg and successfully prevent the original nine-tails cloak from emerging  
the struggle between naruto and sora continues asuma and kazuma fight sai arrives having snuck out of hospital and binds kazuma with an ink snake kazuma breaks out of sais jutsu and charges asuma but is killed naruto eventually reaches sora who manages to release the nine tailss chakra sora then leaves the village to travel the world asuma and shikamaru play shogi and discuss who the king of konoha is elsewhere two akatsuki members hidan and kakuzu appear chasing the two tails jinchūriki  


asuma apologizes at the grave of the third hokage for not understanding his advice concerning what the king of the fire country is at the hospital naruto and sai recover and naruto resumes his training tsunade receives a report from kakashi that akatsuki is again on the move elsewhere yugito nii the two tails jinchūriki struggles against hidan and kakuzu and unleashes her beast form but is defeated and captured hidan and kakuzu then turn their attention to the fire country for their next target  
zetsu arrives to take yugito away as hidan and kakuzu head off for their next assignment naruto meanwhile proceeds to the next step of his training the cutting of a waterfall hidan and kakuzu reach the fire temple and manage to break in once inside they fight chiriku the head monk so that kakuzu would be able to attain the bounty on his head chiriku puts up a strong fight but is ultimately defeated and killed afterwards hidan and kakuzu move out to claim their bounty and thereafter target their next jinchūriki  
the second stage of narutos training continues while tsunade sends out the niju shotai twenty teams composed of four ninja each to deal with and exterminate the akatsuki members in the fire country shikamaru leaves with asuma izumo and kotetsu whereas ino and choji leave with raido and aoba that night sakura cries over her picture of team 7 and naruto after witnessing a shooting star manages to clear the second stage of his training but subsequently collapses from hunger and exhaustion almost immediately afterward  
asumas team arrives at the fire temple and mourns chirikus death izumo realizes that the akatsuki must be trying to claim the bounty on his head elsewhere hidan and kakuzu continue towards the bounty exchange point at ichiraku kakashi tells naruto that he has something up his sleeve that will surprise him back at the training ground kakashi informs naruto what the true purpose of his new training is and begins his explanation by showing naruto his own mastery of the rasengan  
kakashi reveals that the rasengan is an incomplete jutsu as he is not able to combine his own elemental chakra affinity into it just as its creator the fourth hokage could not do he then presumes that naruto might be the first one to be able to do so meanwhile asuma sends word to the other teams about the akatsuki’s location and proceeds on kakuzu then exchanges chirikus corpse narutos training increases his stress to the point that the nine-tailed fox tries to break free but yamato manages to suppress it entirely  
asuma’s team reaches the bounty station and ambushes hidan izumo and kotetsu attack but are unable to kill him despite stabbing vital organs due to hidans immortality asuma says that if they retreat konoha will be endangered shikamaru realizes that asuma is considering sacrificing himself to help defeat the enemy asuma begins fighting hidan while shikamaru distracts him by forcing him to dodge his shadow sewing jutsu hidan cuts asuma on the cheek with his scythe draws a circle of blood on the ground and steps in it as asuma uses a fire style jutsu to engulf hidan in flame  
asuma’s fire jutsu strikes hidan but to his teams surprise asuma gets burnt as well hidan then reveals his ability to link his body to his opponents after ingesting their blood asuma rushes at hidan but collapses after hidan stabs himself in the leg thereby injuring asuma shikamaru realizes hidan needs to be in the circle for his curse ritual to take effect and so uses his shadow possession jutsu to force hidan to step out of it as he does so asuma gets to strike a finishing blow on hidan as hidan screams asuma decapitates hidan with his chakra knife  
hidan’s immortality enables him to stay alive even with his head cut off although he cannot move his body seeing this kakuzu sews hidans head back on his body with threads that sprout from his body izumo and kotetsu try to attack kakuzu but he manages to grab them both by using his body threads restraining them and suffocating them as well hidan now able to move again returns to the circle and stabs himself with the blades of his scythe and he finishes the ritual by stabbing himself in the chest with another spike fatally wounding asuma  
asuma is mortally wounded and collapses shortly thereafter ino choji aoba and raido appear as the teams backup hidan and kakuzu prove to be a match for them too but theyre ordered back to the hideout by their leader to seal the two tails they retreat warning the group that they will return ino tries to treat asuma with her medical jutsu but fails as hidans attacks had damaged his vital organs asuma leaves advice for his students and whispers to shikamaru the identity of the king that konoha must protect as he smokes a final cigarette he dies  
naruto struggles to combine the shape and elemental manipulation in the rasengan elsewhere the akatsuki begin sealing the two-tailed beast and the akatsuki leader reveals akatsuki plans to use the tailed beasts to cause conflict in the ninja nations serving as mercenaries at a lower cost than the ninja of the hidden villages replacing them having monopoly on war and eventually taking over the world meanwhile news of asumas death reaches konoha just as naruto realizes the solution is to use two shadow clones instead of one  
a funeral is held for asuma but shikamaru does not attend it choosing instead to sulk at home after a careful prodding by his father during a game of shogi shikamaru works through his emotions and comes up with a strategy to defeat asumas killers hidan and kakuzu team 10 visits asumas grave before setting out for revenge but tsunade stops them telling them that they need a four-man squad and backup for the mission but kakashi volunteers as the leader of the team when it becomes clear team 10 has no intention of backing down  
tsunade tells sakura that team 7 will be team 10s backup but only if naruto finishes his training within 24 hours elsewhere shikamaru quickly adjusts the teams strategy to include kakashi and yugito dies after having the two tails extracted from her after hidan and kakuzu are found shikamaru pins their shadows with asumas chakra knives imbued with his chakra using his shadow possession jutsu he forces hidan to attack kakuzu but kakuzu dodges the attempt after revealing that he had secretly detached his arm during shikamarus previous attack to remove the chakra knife pinning his shadow with kakuzu cornered choji then attacks kakuzu from above  
chojis spiked cannonball attack proves ineffective against kakuzus special ability which enables him to harden his skin in konoha naruto learns more about the five elemental chakra natures and their strengths and weaknesses in relation to each other kakuzu gets struck by kakashis lightning blade right through his heart but survives and produces four masked entities from his back one of which dies as it had been struck by kakashi kakuzu then uses the masks to attack team 10 with powerful wind lightning and fire jutsus  
shikamaru realizes kakuzu has five hearts each of which must be killed to defeat him he also reasons that separating kakuzu from hidan is the only way to defeat them and so he uses shadow possession jutsu to lead hidan into a dense forest kakuzu combines two of his hearts into a single entity and prepares to face kakashi ino and choji to get a replacement heart at the same time in the forest amidst numerous explosive tags that shikamaru had set up for the akatsuki duo hidan strikes shikamaru with his spear drawing his blood and ingests it he then prepares to use his curse ritual to kill shikamaru  
hidan stabs himself in the chest but instead of mortally wounding shikamaru he accidentally destroys another one of kakuzus hearts when demanded an explanation from hidan about why he still was alive shikamaru reveals to have poured kakazus blood that kakashi had retrieved earlier in a capsule on hidans spear and so he had killed one of kakuzus hearts he also traps hidan with his shadow possession jutsu being temporarily incapacitated kakuzus remaining three hearts return to his body with one sacrificing itself to become his heart just as kakuzu is about to finish them off with another fire-wind jutsu team 7 composed of naruto sakura sai and led by yamato arrives just in time to stop the attack with naruto and yamatos wind-water jutsu combo with naruto apologizing for being late as team 7 brace themselves for battle against kakuzu  
sakura and sai leave to help shikamaru hidan attempts to break out of shikamarus weakened shadow possession jutsu on him but shikamaru pulls the explosive tags onto hidans body shikamaru then opens a trap hole that he had prepared and reveals his plan to bury hidan beneath the nara family woods he has a vision of asuma entrusting his will of fire to him and then throws his lighter to ignite the tags on hidan which explode and dismember the latter meanwhile naruto prepares the new jutsu that he had been developing wind style rasen shuriken  
naruto attacks kakuzu with rasen shuriken but his attack dissipates before he can land a hit meanwhile with hidans dismembered remains in the trap hole shikamaru uses another explosive tag to fill in the hole to finally bury hidan ultimately avenging asumas death he is joined by sakura and sai and they head back to the others naruto once again creates a rasen shuriken and kakuzu switches to a long-range mode to counter his attack as naruto with his shadow clones rush towards kakuzu the latter flies over and nails the original naruto but this is revealed to be a shadow clone and the real naruto manages to lands a critical hit with the second rasen shuriken destroying both of kakuzus replacement hearts  


kakashi finishes off kakuzu and they return home at asumas grave shikamaru tells kurenai he will protect her unborn child he plays shogi with shikaku and reveals what asuma told him the king that konoha must protect is the next generation after studying kakuzus corpse tsunade tells kakashi not to let naruto use rasen shuriken again because it will permanently destroy his ability to manipulate chakra meanwhile orochimaru learns of konohas latest victory and sends kabuto to meet with a woman named guren

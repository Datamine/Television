jack agrees against his better judgment to be debriefed at ctu meanwhile dana discovers that meredith reeds computer was used to hack into the un database and download incriminating files reed is apprehended and brought to ctu for questioning but chloe finds this discovery too easy maintaining that reed might be the victim of a frame she further discovers video footage of an unknown man davros entering and leaving reeds apartment around the time of the hack hastings dismisses her claims so chloe turns to jack who agrees to get involved after kim goes to ctu and gives him her blessing he then tracks davros to the home of nypd policeman jim koernig joe nieves who knows davros as mike farmer a fellow cop davros in the meantime gets in contact with the actual mole hassans brother farhad davros arrives at koernigs home well before jack and asks if he can trade for jims shift on un security detail he attacks koernigs wife sandra purpuro upon being denied his request 
jack bauer arrives at the koernigs home and discovers both jim and maggie murdered by davros he is then apprehended by two nypd officers mazoni and lu domenick lombardozzi and johnny wu mazoni knocks jack unconscious and then proceeds to bind gag and beat him revenging himself against this supposed cop killer meanwhile dana is confronted by a mysterious figure from her past kevin wade clayne crawford who forces himself back into her life by threatening to expose a secret she is hiding from ctu president hassan confirms the rumors that he is having an affair with reed and provides a personal assurance that she is not involved in the plot against him the un treaty meeting is then broken up by intelligence found on reeds computer indicating the presence of a bomb presidents hassan and taylor are evacuated to mcguire air force base via different routes jack freed from his imprisonment by lu receives confirmation that mike farmer the actual murderer is now on the un security detail ready to assassinate president hassan along his evacuation route jack calls ctu at once explaining that the intelligence on reeds computer was planted precisely to cause this evacuation and ortiz risks his life to cut off hassans motorcade just before davros triggers an explosive 
ortiz survives and chases davros into a nearby building though davros is killed tattoos on his body link him to red square a faction of the russian mob who now become the main suspects of the hit on hassan ctu realizes that renee walker worked undercover to infiltrate red square and she is brought in to help with the case jack finds himself concerned for renees safety and state of mind since she had suffered a major breakdown after the events of their previous collaboration he decides to go undercover with her autopsy on davros body reveals that he was exposed to weapons-grade uranium and president hassan reveals that farhad was approached by shadowy individuals who offered to sell some to their country farhad his cover blown stabs a ctu agent and makes his escape linking up with a russian mob figure named bazhaev jürgen prochnow who indeed has uranium for sale the proof is his younger son oleg gene farber who is dying of radiation poisoning after poor safety measures in transporting the rods renee offers to track down one of her old contacts vladimir laitanin callum keith rennie by meeting with ziya dakhilov jon sklaroff a paroled criminal with connections to vladimir ziya explains that he cannot help renee as long as he is wearing his parole bracelet so she solves the problem by removing ziyas left thumb with a power saw 
chloe and dana finalize jacks cover identity german arms dealer ernst meier as ziya transports renee to laitanins hideout his injured hand soothed by the promise of money jack remains nervous of renees condition believing she is using this operation as a chance to act out a death wish despite renee giving all the right answers to vladimirs interrogation he takes her and ziya to the side of a river where he kills ziya and gives renee her last chance to tell the truth renee dares him to do it claiming she has nothing else to live for besides this deal as this is the truth vladimir agrees to work with her president hassan returned safely to the un building has essentially invoked martial law in his home country to prosecute those who were part of the plot to kill him he emphasizes to president taylor that this is necessary to retain his leadership president taylor however sees these human-rights violations as a serious enough reason to call off the peace talks with hassan and his wife dalia necar zadegan leaves him despite his pleas to stay finally bazhaev allows his son josef david anders to transport oleg to a secluded location to die in relative comfort but josef has other ideas and takes oleg to a clinic in mount vernon where he obtains treatment from a doctor eli goodman at gunpoint 
dana walsh under pressure by kevin wade who threatens to reveal that she has served a jail sentence as an accessory to murder agrees to help him break into a police warehouse and steal cash impounded in a drug bust president hassan becomes ruthless in his pursuit of security even arresting jamot navid negahban a member of his delegation who is related to one of the troublemakers back home–who at the time was actively working to pacify the british ambassadors disquiet with hassans policies tarin faroush tj ramini the member of hassans security detail assigned to arrest jamot expresses concern with his presidents actions requesting a private meeting with hassans daughter kayla nazneen contractor bazhaev tracks down his sons kills the staff members at the clinic and then kills oleg all in the name of preserving his familys secrecy josef takes his brothers gold crucifix as a memento finally jack decides to pull renee out of the operation as soon as possible mobilizing ortiz and two ctu tac teams while renee refuses to back down even forcing herself to sleep with vladimir to buy time the armed back-up proves invaluable vladimir decides to kill mr meier and settle for the 5m down payment rather than risk playing with nuclear materials thanks to quick action by ortiz who was surveilling the situation with a sniper rifle jack survives and is taken to vladimir 
guided by dana kevin and his friend nick coughlin michael filipowich bust into the nypd evidence locker though nick spends enough time window-shopping that a patrol officer almost catches them nick beats the officer with a baseball bat and the two escape dana is rattled by the incident and both arlo and hastings notice her preoccupation omar hassan continues to round up people who may be complicit in his brothers plot when tarin tries to reason with him hassan thanks him for taking on the moderating role his wife once played but then has him arrested kayla who is romantically involved with tarin decides to confront her father herself vladimir attempts to contact bazhaev about the nuclear rods so bazhaev sends men to kill vladimirs group intent on keeping the deal secret when renee nags vladimir to continue calling vladimir gets angry and attacks renee she stabs him 18 times and jack once when he attempts to intervene after some bandages and a heart-to-heart jack convinces renee to ignore her doubts and take the position that she acted in self-defense jack and renee turn laitanins files over to ctu for investigation as every phone call laitanin made is a potential lead but bazhaevs hit squad gets there first while renee hides mr meier allows himself to be captured with the intention of leading ctu to bazhaev but by simple expedient of evacuating jack through an underground tunnel his captors get away unnoticed 
bazhaev upon meeting jack has him tortured on suspicions of being a cop and knowing about the nuclear rods renee is brought to ctu she is debriefed by chloe who agrees that she acted in self-defense in killing laitanan hastings knowing of her previous suicide attempt orders renee to be held at medical pending a psychological evaluation meanwhile dana tells cole she has things about her life that she hasnt told him but fails to go into any detail she later heads to a strip club being patronized by kevin and nick planning to kill them jack kills his torturer and escapes he causes a power outage and is ultimately able to capture bazhaev meanwhile at the un kayla tries to confront her father about tarin but he only becomes overprotective upon learning tarin is courting her jack puts bazhaev on the phone with hastings and president taylor arranging an immunity deal for himself and his son in exchange for the rods location based on bazhaevs information cole leads a team to the truck holding the rods only to find the guards at the truck are dead and the rods missing the perpetrator left a clear signal olegs crucifix josef has the rods and is planning to give them to farhad this time at an apartment complex 
bazhaev contacts josef and convinces him to stand down unfortunately farhads men arrive shoot josef and take possession of the rods when rob weiss president taylors chief of staff becomes aware of this he contacts hastings and orders him to finger renee as a scapegoat for the operations failure particularly the death of laitanan she is interviewed by kristen smith merle dandridge from the justice department for this purpose despite misgivings from both hastings and chloe with arlos help cole tracks down dana who has staked out kevins van he and nick are associating with two women from the strip club and is in possession of a suppressed pistol after dana confesses the entire mess cole threatens her associates himself kevin agrees to back off but nick stabs him and then fires at cole with a revolver only a dying kevins panicked shout allows him to defend himself farhad and his associate samir mehran mido hamada link up with some confederates farhad wants to get the rods to kamistan but samir hatches an alternate plan to use them in a dirty radioactive bomb for an immediate attack on manhattan island farhad seemingly in agreement feels pangs of conscience escaping to contact ctu for help jack whose romantic chemistry with renee has finally come to fruition agrees to extract farhad in exchange for hastings canceling the criminal investigation into her conduct 
with the help of one of his men bashir tarin escapes custody and makes plans to seek political asylum in the united states kayla comes with him leading president hassan to fear for her safety she is somewhere in new york city and could possibly fall victim to samirs dirty-bomb plot he pleads with his wife dalia to help him locate their daughter dana and cole hide the bodies of kevin and nick and return to ctu their impending nuptials now in question hastings tells rob weiss in no uncertain terms that he has no intention of continuing the criminal investigation into renees conduct and jack invites her to stay at his apartment one of samirs henchmen ali ethan rains kills farhad just before ctu can arrive on-site but jack hatches a plan to announce to the media that he is alive and being transported to a local hospital in the hopes of luring the terrorists into attacking samir falls for the bait sending young half-american marcos al-zacar rami malek to the hospital in a suicide vest complicating the issue is the fact that jacks ctu tac team is relatively inexperienced and marcos picks its leader agent owen julian morris to escort him to farhads room though owen almost cracks under the strain he is able to help chloe disarm the explosives remotely marcos weaponless and pursued by ctu barricades himself in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and contacts samir for help in detonating the vest manually 
dalia returns to the un building to assist president hassan in tracking down kayla leaving her daughter several voice mails cole and dana return to ctu and are chewed out by hastings cole admits that he still loves dana but would rather focus on the crisis at hand this is complicated by a call from probation officer bill prady stephen root who is trying to locate kevin wade and arranges a meeting with dana meanwhile marcos continues to manually re-arm his explosives while samir installs ali at the hospital to guarantee success chloe uncovers marcos biography including the fact that his mother elaine mare winningham is in manhattan cole escorts her to the hospital where she tries to reason with her son but it takes jacks cold-eyed threats to her safety to change marcoss mind unfortunately ali is able to activate a fail-safe code and the vest begins to tick down from sixty seconds as jack struggles to disarm it he is unsuccessful but marcos gives up a name begging jack to tell my mother im sorry before dashing into the hyperbaric chamber jack barely closes the door enough to contain the blast jack contacts president hassan with the information that his chief of security tarin faroush is going to help samir get the rods into manhattan dalia finally gets her daughter to answer her phone and kayla although disbelieving of her lovers involvement in the plot confesses their location 
despite or perhaps due to the presence of headstrong nypd swat tarin escapes with kayla and brings her to samirs hideout an abandoned bank vault samir contacts president hassan and offers to trade her life for file 33 which turns out to be a detailed how-to document on circumventing americas radiological defenses jack urges hassan to stall while ctu track down the terrorists dana meets with officer prady who has clearance to obtain ctus records of the security-camera footage of nick and kevins robbery deciding to come clean she calls cole to wish him a teary good-bye kayla convinces tarin to help her escape but tarin is shot as they flee kayla takes his car and calls ctu on tarins cell phone jack and cole arrive at the bank vault to find samir and his confederates gone arlos drones monitor them on the street and facial recognition identifies one of them as tarin very much alive the entire escape having been faked jack realizes that kaylas car currently arriving at ctu must be armed with a weapon that can take out the entire office this weapon is revealed to be an emp bomb kayla is evacuated from the car before the bomb detonates but ctu the linchpin of nycs radiological detection grid has been incapacitated giving samir freedom to launch his attack 
jack calls the national security agency gets them up to speed and has them close all bridges in and out of manhattan he cole and ctu agents owen and king matt yang king take the riverfront they find samir and tarin loading the bomb into a zodiac raft but are pinned down by sniper fire and cellphone jamming from samirs rearguard nsa sends it support led by frank haynum chris mcgarry to ctu to help them restore functionality he immediately butts heads with chloe concerned for jacks safety chloe proposes a risky shortcut that will either restore telecom in half the time or electrocute her after pulling a gun on haynum and almost being arrested she obtains hastings support tries her method and succeeds jack orders his squad to make for a land-line phone but his undisciplined troops panic both king and owen are killed jack then sacrifices himself as a distraction killing several assailants but taking several rounds to the vest while cole runs to the phone only the intervention of renee walker whom chloe had mobilized to search for him saves him from death at the terrorists hands finally dana turns officer prady away with news that the emp wiped out the security-camera footage he had come to her for prady then makes good on his threat to contact hastings so dana strangles him and hides his corpse in a ventilation duct she then calls samir and tells him to hurry as she doubts she can retain her cover for much longer 
president taylor asks jack to escort president hassan and his family to mcguire afb he and renee reinforce a secret service detail headed by molly oconnor christina cox moments later taylor is contacted by samir who offers not to detonate the dirty bomb in exchange for hassan taylor refuses to negotiate even though rob weiss points out that hassan might even consent to the trade afterward weiss is approached by gen david brucker michael gaston who offers to capture hassan using a wet works team and then surrender him to samir ethan kanin blunders into the middle of this plan and suffers a heart attack but sneaks a covert call to jack on his cell phone even this completely silent call arouses jacks suspicions and he is able to retreat and counter-ambush defeating the mercenaries with help from renee fbi retd and omar hassan general irk army retd they capture adrion bishop michael irby the teams co and from him learn of the terrorists offer samir realizing that hassan will not be handed over instructs tarin to deploy the radiological weapon in the upper west side and activate its 15-minute timer 
as jack marches his team towards the surface president hassan overpowers him and joins forces with bishop agreeing to sacrifice his life to save thousands of innocents tarin is ordered to deactivate the bomb which has 7 seconds to spare he thereafter takes custody of hassan and releases the bomb to bishop while renee takes dalia and kayla to mcguire afb and ctu dismantles the bomb jack informs taylor of weiss complicity she has him and brucker arrested and kanin given medical attention ctu sets up an ambush for tarin which dana is only barely able to warn him of tarin takes refuge in a parking structure and eventually resorts to driving his car off the top floor no one could survive that chloe gasps and indeed tarin didnt but omar is not in the car having been passed off to confederates at some previous time he is delivered into samirs hands while tarins ability to avoid an ambush that was planned just moments before makes jack suspect a mole inside ctu 
jack sends renee to ctu to brief chloe on his mole theory using the contents of tarins smartphone she identifies dana as samirs inside agent dana once captured refuses to negotiate with anyone but jack she knows that her immunity deal will be contingent on ctu recovering omar hassan and that jack is the only agent who could possibly do so her intel is sufficient to launch a rescue and jack renee and cole take the field to recover him president taylor consults with a recovering ethan kanin on contingency plans in case hassan should be killed ethans opinion is that the peace accords will flounder without him an attitude reinforced by the clear hostility of russian foreign minister mikhail novakovich graham mctavish to the entire process samir plans to broadcast live over the internet his torture of hassan hassans confession of his crimes and his eventual execution this plays out as jack and his team infiltrate the apartment building after a tense ascent jack defeats samir and his henchmen only to discover that samirs live broadcast was actually of a pre-recorded video playing on a laptop hassans corpse is still in the room a tearful president taylor breaks the news to kayla and dalia while president omar hassan receives a silent clock 
after apologizing to president taylor for his failure jack officially withdraws from involvement with ctu having reached the end of his mission to protect omar hassan at his apartment he and renee finally have the chance to kindle their romance jamot comes to taylor with a plan for salvaging the peace accords they ask dalia hassan to step into her husbands office which she agrees to do despite kaylas concerns for her safety novakovich is preparing to abandon the treaty so ethan calls in support from an unexpected quarter impeached president and season 5 archvillain charles logan gregory itzin who is willing to use his contacts in moscow to keep russia at the table despite her misgivings taylor accepts his assistance tim woods demotes brian hastings chloe is surprised to learn that she will be his interim replacement her first crisis occurs when samir shot by jack but expected to survive for interrogation dies of sudden cardiac arrest in ctus medical wing after cole admits that he cannot account for everyone who was near samir during his captivity she orders his body screened for poisons her instincts are accurate a russian agent pavel tokarev joel bissonnette reports samirs assassination to novakovich and mentions that he recognized jacks assistant renee zadan from their mutual association with vladimir laitanan to prevent renee from revealing russian complicity in the kamistani plot pavel prepares to kill her and jack observing their lovemaking with sniper rifle in hand renee on the phone with chloe mentions in turn that she might have recognized pavel when she saw him in his emt disguise but pavel shoots her before she can make a positive identification jack exfiltrates her under fire and rushes her to the hospital but within moments the doctors emerge defeated renee receives a silent clock as jack weeps over her body 
logan blackmails novakovich into returning to treaty negotiations by threatening to reveal russias complicity in samirs attacks jacks investigations lead him back to ctu to interrogate dana walsh who according to bazhaev was placed at ctu by the russian government and has evidence and names of conspirators thereby logan finds out and is forced to reveal the truth about the russians to president taylor logan convinces taylor that if the russians are exposed they will back out of the peace negotiations and destroy any chance of peace with the irk taylor travels to ctu to meet jack in person and after a heated exchange orders him to stand down jack is to be taken off-site by helicopter for debriefing but holds his escort at gunpoint and escapes alone on the helicopter leaving chloe with no choice but to order fighter patrols to force him down 
president taylor in doubt about her complicity in covering up the russian conspiracy is convinced by logan to hire a private security firm to take dana walsh into custody these men led by mark bledsoe d b sweeney have orders to obtain by any means necessary the evidence she was going to give to jack thus removing her leverage over the treaty and taylors administration ethan kanin resigns from his position in protest while bledsoe calls logans aide jason pillar reed diamond asking what should be done with dana after they are finished with her in his professional opinion they should kill her and arrange for it to look like she was escaping jack lands his stolen helicopter and evades pursuit on foot contacting old friend jim ricker michael madsen for help in re-arming he also obtains several pay-as-you-go cell phones from which he pleads with chloe to help him gain access to walsh chloe agrees and is able to obtain the location of the security firms hideout but decides to instead lure jack into a trap at a ctu safe house where cole and his team are positioned to capture him jack who knows chloe too well sees through the deception takes cole hostage and then convinces him to assist in rescuing dana 
while dalia hassan speaks at the un jack and cole infiltrate and rescue dana from the private safe house she takes them to a bank where she has a joint account with cole and where she has a safe-deposit box containing her evidence charles logan proposes to president taylor that his aide jason pillar be sent to ctu to take over as head of manhunt for bauer taylor agrees to this while logan meets with novakovich and makes it clear that it is in russian interests to have jack stopped and requests that novakovich deploy his nations covert operatives to deal with jack novakovich assigns pavel to the hit and jason begins to feed pavel information from inside ctu danas safebox in addition to a memory card contains a suppressed pistol and a flashbang trap which incapacitates cole dana calls nypd and sets them on jack before escaping on foot despite police interference jack resumes his pursuit of dana after a brief gun fight and chase jack corners dana collects the incriminating data and despite her pleas for mercy executes her 
while nypd takes cole into custody and turns him over to ctu jack peruses danas memory stick which shows her meeting with pavel to organize both hassans assassination and the dirty-bomb plot but does not indicate who either of them is reporting to after securing more help from jim ricker he contacts meredith reed and offers to give the evidence to her ctu intercepts this phone call and logan calls pavel with orders to set up an ambush chloe takes note of pillars secretive actions and begins to suspect that he is involved with the conspirators with arlos semi-willing assistance she begins a private manhunt for jack logan convinces president taylor to publicly praise his involvement in the signing of the peace treaty this backfires spectacularly when jack uses reed to lure the russian assassins out into the open capturing pavel and killing the rest with the help of ricker pillar urges logan to back out and deny all involvement but logan decides to stay in the spotlight jack gives danas evidence to reed and then attempts to get the answers out of pavel by brutally torturing him but for once in jacks life his preferred interrogation methods do not have any impact finally it occurs to jack that pavels cell phone might give him everything he needs but pavel managed to drop his phone dislodge its sim card and swallow it during his brief captivity jack cuts him open to retrieve it avenging renee the redial feature takes an astonished jack to the voicemail of president charles logan 
meredith reed with jacks evidence safely in hand phones her editor gary klausner thomas ryan to arrange for publication of the evidence on the memory card as per logans advice president taylor issues an executive order in an attempt to quash this story ricker locates logan via his phone number and secret services travel manifests — logan is on his way to the airfield to meet the russian president yuri suvarov nick jameson with this information jack intercepts logans motorcade and kidnaps him forcing him to reveal that pavel was reporting to novakovich as the ctu tactical teams close in jack knocks logan unconscious and escapes chloe and arlo manage to track down jim ricker she secures coles release and sends him to rickers address in the hope of tracking down jack after klausner tells meredith that their office is being investigated by the fbi she manages to contact kayla hassan and arrange a meeting with dalia but is shortly thereafter taken into custody by the bureau logan after being recovered by ctu tac teams and jason pillar phones novakovich to warn him of jacks impending attack but the phone is answered by the last of novakovichs men who reveals that jack has already come and gone killing everyone in his path logan then phones suvarov who has just landed and assures him that the trail of evidence stopped at novakovich and that suvarov who actually gave the orders will not be implicated jack however planted a bug on logan during their earlier altercation and overhears this conversation despite a serious wound taken in the fight against novakovichs men he sets off with revenge in mind 
cole ortiz on the orders of ctu director chloe obrian locates jim ricker and persuades him to comply in the ongoing search for jack bauer logan informs president taylor that suvarov was complicit in hassans assassination shaking taylors resolve further jack kidnaps pillar and uses him to sneak inside the un after getting some field sutures from him he attempts to execute pillar but has a change of heart and simply leaves him unconscious and locked in the trunk of his own car allison taylor goes to dalia hassan and confesses the entire story dalia refuses to sign the peace agreement in light of the possible russian involvement in her husbands death but a thunderous taylor blackmails her into remaining by threatening to use samirs failed bomb attack as a pretense for a declaration of war jack sets up a sniper position in a building across from the un in anticipation of suvarovs arrival and then records a video message to kim telling his side of the story here chloe finds him and begs him to stand down but he incapacitates her with a sleeper hold jack then places the cross-hairs on charles logan and forces him to lure suvarov to his office 
chloe regains consciousness and persuades jack not to shoot suvarov and start a war instead offering to help him publicize his evidence jack capitulates and formulates a plan in which she must shoot him as if he were attacking her which she eventually accedes to pillar suspects her of complicity with jack and has her and cole shadowed ctu thus recovers the data card before chloe can upload its contents and logan later presents it to president taylor he informs her that jack will need to be done away with and she allows him to set up a hit on jacks ambulance convoy taylor then views the data card which along with the incriminating recordings of conversations between logan and suvarov contains jacks video to kim which engenders a change of heart in her at the signing ceremony she confesses her role in the cover-up and also attempts to have logans ambush of jacks medical convoy called off but is unsuccessful when logan finds out that his involvement has been revealed he shoots both pillar and himself in the head at ctu chloe takes charge again and locates jack he is on the verge of execution when taylor orders his assassins to stand down her words backed up by the weaponry on a ctu surveillance drone via satellite phone she apologizes to jack and declares that she will soon announce her resignation and accept her punishment whatever it may be she advises him to flee the country as the russians and americans will both be after him jack via a drone camera asks chloe to protect kim and her family as he suspects they will be used in order to lure him out of hiding chloe gives him her word that they will be protected before disappearing jack tells chloe that when she first came to ctu he had never once thought she was going to have his back all these years and thanks her as he begins to flee chloe has the drone camera shut off and the final clock of the show counts down instead of up from three seconds to a series-concluding 000000

tōsen does not seem to fight as well in his new form now that he can see but still easily defeats komamura with a cero as he charges another cero to finish komamura who has given up hisagi stabs tōsen then claims that if he did not have sight he could have easily dodged his attack hisagi releases his zanpakuto and slices tōsen through the neck dispelling his hollowfied form meanwhile hirako releases his shikai which has the ability to create great visual illusions he calls the inverted world shinji seems to have the upper hand and hits aizen several times however aizen messed with his senses earlier claiming that his zanpakutos abilities are a far cry from his and slices hirakos back the defeated tōsen comes to his senses and requests to see hisagis face clearly once more but dies when an internal impact destroys his body hisagi is devastated while komamura rages at aizen who purposely killed tosen at this point ichigo appears behind aizen preparing to attack him  
ichigos attack fails to wound aizen who easily overwhelms him but does not kill him as aizen starts questioning ichigos purpose for fighting him komamura calms him and tells him to not fall for his ruse all of the captains and visoreds then join in to protect ichigo so that he does not witness aizens shikai so that he can finish him off after hitsuguya charges in aizen provokes him to attack with all his hatred aizen mentions momo and if the hatred had disappeared because of her and hitsugaya attacks in a rage hitsugaya releases his bankai as the other soul reapers join him

the story begins with a seventh-grade boy named mikey kudou dreaming of commanding a digimon army the next day harassed by his childhood friend angie hinomoto over standing her up to help the basketball team and his rival jeremy tsurugi demanding a kendo rematch mikey spots a dying red creature flickering in static wanting save the creature mikey hears a mysterious voice which presents him with a fusion loader which absorbs the creature to heal him within the item as mikey grabs it against his friends pleas mikey and his friends are then sucked into a portal and find themselves in a strange world surrounded by a hostile platoon of digimon under madleomon the group is rescued by ballistamon starmon and the pickmons before the red creature emerges from the fusion loader and introduces himself as shoutmon while stating his intent to become the king of the digital world after shoutmon and his companions fight back against his troops madleomon absorbs his remaining forces to become armed madleomon intent to help his new friends out mikey uses his fusion loader to digifuse shoutmon and ballistamon into an incomplete shoutmon ×3/x4 after injuring armed madleomon prior to reverting to his usual self shoutmon uses the digifused starmon and pickmon in the form of the sun sword to defeat madleomon while forcing him back to his original form a portal then appears with madleomon and his minions recalled by their master tacticmon who is seen conversing with other evil digimon over the new turn of events as mikey and his friends learn they are trapped in the digital world the former agreeing to help out shoutmon and his friends they are watched from afar by two other groups  
with the addition of more humans his forces being decimated by the mysterious boy with a fusion loader of his own a livid madleomon decides to rectify this turn of events taken by shoutmon to see the village of light mikey and his friends encounter jijimon and learn of the bagra army before the village is being bombed by a pteramon while mikey digifuses pickmon slingshot for shoutmon and ballistamon to use to take out the pteramon angie briefly encounters cutemon and dorulumon before being found by mikey and telling him to help her find a way to return to their world fearing his chances of becoming king of the digi world would be gone if mikey leaves shoutmon attempts to discourage the boys departure by treating mikey to a party and then reminding him of his sense of responsibility however revealing the presence of other humans and getting upset with angie while admitting his reasons for mikey to stay shoutmon ends up screwing things up as mikey ends their friendship and heads into the forest with his friends the next morning unfortunately madleomon begins his assault and unleashes the orochimon his forces brought with them to corner the children though shoutmon and ballistamon come to their rescue with starmon and the pickmons getting them to safety the children watch as madleomon absorbs orochimon to become madleomon orochi mode and pulverize the two digimon however upon hearing shoutmons reason of wanting to become king in order to protect his village and friends mikey turns the tide by digifusing shoutmon and ballistamon into shoutmon ×2 who sends madleomon running after defeating his orochi mode form reverting him to his usual form nearby the mysterious girl watches with added interest as mikey and shoutmon become friends again  
after he and the other generals meet with their shadowed leader bagramon over the matter of the new humans tactimon gives madleomon a final chance to redeem himself while sending a drimogemon into the forest zone at that time with shoutmon providing an insignia the group are in discussion of their team name when a bunch of giant bamboo shoots rise from the ground surrounding the village of light revealed by jijimon to be an event that has occurred prematurely with jeremy caught on top of one of the shoots mikey attempts to save him when the mysterious boy named christopher aonuma appears and wants mikey to serve him as a member of the blue army with mikey more interested in saving jeremy it resulted with shoutmon and the others fighting a losing battle against mailbirdramon after mikey refuses on the ground of him mistreating a golemon he summoned to aid mailbirdramon christopher departs just as madleomon attacks with several apemon and a pteramon upon confronting shoutmon ×2 madleomon absorbs the apemon to become madleomon final mode and takes advantage of the bamboo to overpower shoutmon ×2 luckily with cutemon appearing to help get the village residents to safety dorulumon aids shoutmon ×2 while jeremy uses the star sword to destroy drimogemon so the bamboo shoots can return underground furious once he is defeated by shoutmon ×2 and dorulumon madleomon initiates a self-destruct sequence to take out everyone remembering his dream mikey digifuses dorulumon with shoutmon and ballistamon to form shoutmon ×3 who knocks madleomon into the air to safely destroy him for good as dorulumon and cutemon leave mikey christens his group as the fusion fighters before they notice a microchip descending from madleomons demise the fusion fighters are then approached by the mysterious girl as she introduces herself as nene amano and explains the item is a code crown  
after introducing herself revealing that the digital world was broken up into zones nene explains to the fusion fighters that a code crown fragment is proof of ownership of a zone and gathering them all would allow one to rule the digital world after nene teaches mikey how to zone transfer he and his friends arrive at the island zone where they save the zones elder archelomon from a group of gizamon searching for the zones code crown after recognizing jijimon archelomon says that the code crown is in a place that is very difficult to get to until they gather digibites for an upcoming festival while gathering the digibites shoutmon befriends an island zone resident named chibitortomon by that time the bagra armys invading commander neptunmon learns of the fusion fighters presence from one of the gizamon and receives orders from tactimon to stop them with a fleet of mantaraymon and divermon while jijimon keeps archelomon and the others hidden the fusion fighters head underwater to infiltrate the mantaraymon fleet and destroy them from within when neptunmon gets word of this he sends octomon to sink the hijacked mantaraymon and drown its occupants however inspired by shoutmons words chibitortomon aids the fusion fighters by digifusing onto shoutmon ×2 to form shoutmon ×2 plus m turning the table however chibitortomons action results with archelomons location compromised as he is captured by neptunmon  
after neptunmon learns the location of the code crown from archelomon mikey and his friends see a platoon of flymon with digibites and dynamite to lure out the code crowns guardian a huge digimon named kingwhamon who is the island as mikey goes to save shoutmon when he risks himself to take out the explosives they are both swallowed by kingwhamon with the flymon following mikey uses the pickmons to help find the code crown only for the flymon to beat them to the punch with their leader stinging a deadly venom into shoutmon luckily hearing the prayers of mikeys friends kingwhamon flushes out the flymon before giving mikey some of his oil to cure shoutmon and giving his blessing for them to take the code crown upon exiting kingwhamon mikey and shoutmon are attacked by neptunmons ebidramon who proves to be a tough match for shoutmon ×2 with digifusions proving ineffective against ebidramon kingwhamon reveals that there is a set of digicards holding the data of legendary digimon in a shrine under him chibitortomon retrieves a box containing the digicards with mikey summoning leviamon to literally disarm ebidramon so shoutmon ×2 can destroy him however the victory is short lived as neptunmon unleashes an army of seadramon to personally lead against the fusion fighters to take the code crown from them  
neptunmon uses archelomon as ransom for the code crown and digicards before mikey can give up the items having heard of the fusion fighters progress from nene christopher arrives on mailbirdramon and takes out some of the seadramon while offering to deal with the rest in return for the digicards turning down the offer yet thanking christopher for taking out some of their opponents mikey uses marineangemons digicard to summon a bunch of marineangemon whose kahuna waves subside the seadramon and neptunemon using syakomon and her kin as a bridge shoutmon ×2 carries mikey and jeremy toward neptunmon with the latter using the rare star sword to free archelomon neptunmon then knocks them into the water and has the seadramon freeze the ocean surface to trap them luckily as the fight was disrupting his fishing dorulumon arrives to free the fusion fighters and archelomon mikey then digifuses shoutmon ballistamon and dorulumon with the star sword into shoutmon ×4 shoutmon ×4 ends up fighting against neptunmons sentient kings bite spear ultimately using neptunmon as a shield against his own weapon though a dying neptunmon makes one final attempt to kill everyone kingwhamon saves the fusion fighters tactimon is infuriated by the turn of events soon after as christopher departs to let them make his job of harvesting more code crowns easier for him chibitortomon officially joins the fusion fighters while mikey is unable to convince dorulumon to join their group  
the fusion fighters arrive in the magma zone and decide to take a dip in the hot springs before they are ambushed by an army of redmeramon lead by skullmeramon and his aide bluemeramon although they manage to beat the army recognizing mikey as the one with the red fusion loader skullmeramon proves to be too much for shoutmon ×2 until cutemons appearance results in dorulumon forcing the enemy digimon to fall back when mikey attempts to talk dorulumon into joining the fusion fighters cutemon reveals that he travels with him to look for his parents after his home town was raided by the bagra army though dorulumon refused to join them mikey decides to follow him as the fusion fighters stumble upon an enslavement camp of digimon digging for the code crown while the uninterested dorulumon takes his leave the fusion fighters attempt to break their way into the prison under the cover of night but find themselves in a trap skullmeramon prepared however having learned from a discarded bearmon that cutemons parents are being held captive there dorulumon arrives at the prison with mikey forming shoutmon ×3 to defeat skullmeramon with some encouragement from cutemon but before the fusion fighters could succeed in freeing the captive digimon they encounter the commanding officer in charge of the bagra armys magma zone branch ancientvolcanomon  
realizing that prolonging the fight might cause the caves to collapse and kill the prisoners mikey decides to surrender and gives ancientvolcanomon a fake fusion loader with shoutmon the only member of the fusion fighters not to realize the deception mikey explains that the surrender allows them to find the prisoners once at the cell cutemon learns from a prairiemon that his parents have transferred to a different facility with mikey and dorulumon convincing him that there is still hope as his parents are still alive eventually motivating the prisoners to help them the fusion fighters start to dig their way through the walls with dorulumon deciding to help out of respect for mikeys resolve by that time ancientvolcanomon soon learns the fusion loader is a fake from skullmeramon as he and an army of redmeramon attempt to capture the escapees though shoutmon ×2 manages to defeat skullmeramons group he is easily defeated by ancientvolcanomon who proves to be a match for even shoutmon ×4 after a failed attempt to hinder ancientvolcanomon with the agumons digicard mikey tells shoutmon ×4 to plug up the volcano on his opponents back with ancientvolcanomon suffering from magma build up he is knocked into a nearby volcano however as the sun rises the fusion fighters encounter one of the bagra armys three generals tactimon learning that he was in the magma zone aiding the fusion fighters tactimon reveals that dorulumon was once his right-hand man in the bagra army  
despite learning that dorulumon was a member of the bagra army mikey says that he still trusts him as tactimon summons his sword of storms and uses it to separate mikey and dorulumon from the others while taking the fusion loader as ancientvolcanomon and his forces gather tactimon is about to have mikey and dorulumon executed when christopher arrives and challenges tactimon taking advantage of the distraction the fusion fighters are able to free mikey and dorulumon with help from bluemeramon while revealing that he has a debt with dorulumon for saving his life when used as a sacrificial pawn in tactimons strategy with dorulumon leaving the bagra army soon after bluemeramon leads the fusion fighters to mikeys fusion loader before sacrificing himself to save dorulumon from skullmeramon shoutmon destroys skullmeramon and by the time christopher has maildramon take their fight with tactimon elsewhere before making a tactical retreat with his partner greymon the fusion fighters then confront ancientvolcanomon and the redmeramon army ancientvolcanomon absorbs the defeated redmeramon to become fused ancientvolcanomon increasing his power mikey saves dorulumon with garurumons digicard mikey then digifuses dorulumon with shoutmon to form the drill cannon to weaken fused ancientvolcanomon before finishing him off with shoutmon ×3 with dorulumon finally agreeing to join them as they gain the magma zones code crown the fusion fighters head off for the next zone  
arriving in the lake zone mikey and his friends find a group of frozen digimon before hearing a voice calling out noting it to be similar to shoutmon mikey learns that the zones warrior knightmon has been defeated on the verge of drowning in the nearly frozen lake diving in to load knightmon into his fusion loader mikey is saved by chibitortomon as he and the other fusion fighters aid the lake zone army in driving off the bagra army platoon under lalyamons subordinate icedevimon moments later at the castle the fusion fighters are introduced to the lake zones princess beastmon with knightmon telling her they have found their champion however beastmon reveals she found another candidate in christopher while a banquet is served mikey and christopher get into a conversation which is interrupted by jeremy ballistamon as well as knightmon though the three state their distrust in christopher after he leaves mikey thinks the youth is hiding something and wants to help when the bagra army resumes their attack with shoutmon and half of the fusion fighters unable to get up from overeating christopher digifuses greymon and mailbirdramon into metalgreymon to annihilate most of the army mikey then realizes that the fight is a distraction as icedevimon and the icemon sneaked into the castle to capture beastmon luckily shoutmon gets his second wind to hinder the abduction with mikey and the others meeting up with him in retaliation icedevimon absorbs the icemon to become icedevimon enhancement absorbent and freezes ballistamon as metal greymon holds off the bagra armys assassin reapmon after shoutmon uses the drill cannon to save him from icedevimon knightmon and his pawnchessmon drive off icedevimon with christopher taking his leave admitting to not being comfortable with her cuddling beastmon names mikey her champion before he collapses from exhaustion meanwhile laylamon is at a gate that opens to reveal a gigantic digimon  
watching the still unconscious mikey being watched over by beastmon angie begins to question her usefulness to the others as jeremy is commanding the fusion fighters to hold off icedevimons army later that night while she has icedevimon thawing out a huge digimon that would replace him laylamon uses a mirror in order to take control of angie with the delusion that she can return to her world if she steals the code crown from beastmon as angie obtains the code crown the sun begins to rise and she makes her way to the other side of the lake where laylamon is waiting with a defrosted daipenmon a frozen icedevimon as well as an army of icemon though the fusion fighters and beastmons army attempt to drive them off daipenmon ends up freezing them as mikey wakes up and sees angie being spirited away joined by jeremy and other fusion fighters mikey arrives and convinces angie that she is their friend and that they still need her freed from laylamons spell as a result angie ends up scarring the demon digimons face with the lake zones code crown overcome with utter rage laylamons power digifuses icedevimon with daipenmon into icedevimon-daipenmon enhancement absorbent and she uses her follower to attack the fusion fighters just then knightmon and the pawnchessmon arrive to protect the fusion fighters from icedevimon-daipenmons attack mikey then digifuses shoutmon ballistamon dorulumon starmon and the pickmons with knightmon and the pawnchessmon to form shoutmon ×4k who destroys icedevimon-daipenmon soon after the fusion fighters membership increases with the addition of beastmon knightmon and the pawnchessmon elsewhere after overseeing mikeys fight nene offers an alliance with christopher while revealing both her black fusion loader and her partner sparrowmon  
while traveling through the portal to the next zone the fusion fighters notice land masses floating around jijimon briefly emerges telling them that those are digiworld zones they have acquired and how they were each originally part of a single digital world prior to the true code crown being shattered arriving to the sand zone the fusion fighters learn of a treasure located in its capital city and decide to get it however after being in the hot sun the fusion fighters fall for a pit trap by a skullscorpiomon with dorulumon helping them escape from skullscorpiomon attack the fusion fighters end up underground where they cross paths with another of the bagra army generals blastmon though blastmon is not interested in them the fusion fighters end up surrounded by a bunch of skullscorpiomon before being saved by deputymon who enlists their help to get the treasure arriving at the gate leading to the treasure which only opened after angie blows a kiss at it the fusion fighters find themselves running from a rolling bigmamemon that they manage to evade once at a bridge blastmon catches up but is more focused than his forces on getting the treasure than disposing of the fusion fighters after he accidentally plunges off the bridge after mikey activates the magnaangemon digicard to send both blastmons vilemon posse and the skullscorpionmon to the surface the fusion fighters are shocked to find deputymon turning on them as he tells them that theyre going to fight the sand zones ruler pharaohmon while he gets the treasure once teleported to the sanctum of pharaohmon despite mikeys attempt to explain their just cause shoutmon ×4 is formed to fight him however mikey ends up figuring out that pharaohmon and deputymon were testing their worth and stops the fight as mikey receives the sand zones code crown and four new digicards blastmon returns to the surface where he battles sparrowmon before learning the treasure is a code crown before he could go after the fusion fighters blastmon is suddenly attacked by mailbirdramon as christopher summons cyberdramon while reapmon watches from afar  
emerging from the ruins as blastmon continues his battle with cyberdramon and sparrowmon the fusion fighters find themselves under fire by reapmon as mikey attempts to get his fusion loader reapmon only allows it out of fairness after seeing the nearby cliff he shot at break off to reveal a statue engaging shoutmon ×4 before blastmon unleashes an attack that hits the surrounding area knocking mikey off the cliff while everyone takes cover the fight taking a lot out of him blastmon takes his leave out of vanity coming to at the bottom of the gorge mikey finds the statue is still intact as he feels a glow from it before seeing reapmon behind him explaining the statue is of a goddess reapmon offers to show mikey the way out while moving through the cavern with reapmon using guilmon digicard to clear some boulders mikey learns the area was home to the warriors of light led by angemon who cared for reapmon as a child despite not being acknowledged by the goddess as a warrior of light however reapmon was forced to kill angemon and their order when they suddenly fell under a spell and he joined the bagra army to find out the identity of the one responsible for his orders downfall when they get to the surface mikey and reapmon discover that shoutmon ballistamon dorulumon cutemon as well as deputymon have fallen under the same spell that befell the warriors of light by then laylamon arrives with the skullscorpiomon army and ebemon with reapmon revealing his true motives as he break ebemons hold on the digimon when laylamon impales reapmon when he attempts to kill her mikey forms shoutmon ×4 to destroy ebemon and drive lalyamon off as reapmon loses consciousness from the poison that laylamon introduced into his body  
after reapmon was fatally wounded by laylamon and he and shoutmon ×4 unable to reach him mikey is instructed by pharaohmon to use the sand zones code crown which raises a pyramid that unites the other pyramids into a shrine of healing with a barrier erected to keep the fusion fighters safe from the bagra army after being told that his status as a warrior of light can save reapmon mikey uses his fusion loader to begin the process with shoutmon ×4 reverting back to his components while the rest of the fusion fighter digimon are ejected from the fusion loader by that time with skullscorpiomon unable get through the barrier laylamon summons machinedramon to disable it for her forces to get through while mikey tries to heal reapmon despite he and shoutmon believing it to be a waste of time the fusion fighters hold off the skullscorpiomon before laylamon allows machinedramon to devour all the skullscorpiomon and the defeated fusion fighter digimon to upgrade itself luckily reapmon convinces mikey to come to his friends aid and forms shoutmon ×4k to take out machinedramon however machinedramon upgraded into himachinedramon and nearly destroys shoutmon ×4k were it not for reapmon taking the fatal blow luckily accepted as a warrior of light reapmon reincarnates into beelzemon and helps shoutmon ×4k in defeating himachinedramon as beelzemon takes his leave a furious laylamon bent on making them suffer sends the fusion fighters flying into one of the worst digital zones  
after being sent through a portal created by lalyamon the fusion fighters arrive at a floating city-type zone and are amazed by their surroundings accidentally falling off a ledge mikey is saved by shakkoumon who warns the fusion fighters not to be fooled by appearances in the sky zone at that time dondokomons attempt to play alongside a pucchiemon orchestra gets him in trouble with a piximon police officer whose rant of the numerous laws the fusions fighters had unknowingly broken attracts the attention of his superior gargolyemon luckily the fusion fighters get help from a resident named lucemon who takes the punishment in their stead after the argument is resolved lucemon tells mikey and his group that gargoylemon is a member of the police under slushangemon who is the zones president he explains that slushangemon has ensured none of the bagra army would attack the sky zone allowing his fellow residents to live a peaceful and artistic life but due to slushangemons methods of maintaining order lucemon reveals his intent to become president to remove the harsh laws that have placed everyone in fear taking them on a balloon tour while explaining that shakkoumon is not one to be trusted lucemon brings the fusion fighters to an art gallery where it appears dondokomon knocks down a sculpture gargoylemon arrives and arrests dondokomon for the act of vandalism along with mikey and shoutmon for obstructing justice while being interrogated mikey knows that finding the real culprit is the only way to clear their names as he and the others are freed by their team mates however the fusion fighters are knocked out by slushangemon and prepared to be executed the next day in the arena lucemon attempts to denounce slushangemons justice system as a kyupimon confesses that he accidentally broke the statue while playing with kyupimon now being executed in their place mikey refuses to allow it as he forms shoutmon ×4 to fight slushangemon however shoutmon ×4 is overwhelmed by slushangemons speed until beelzemon arrives and tells mikey to digifuse him with shoutmon to create shoutmon ×4b though shoutmon ×4b gets the upper hand against slushangemon mikey stops him from finishing their opponent off as lucemons words to slushangemon to spare kyupimons life gain the crowds support to become the sky zones new leader with shakkoumon watching from afar  
as slushangemon prepares to pass his president title to lucemon shoutmon finds lucemon in the library studying and becomes dejected while noticing shakkoumon in the shadows when lucemon arrives for his coronation shakkoumon appears and is revealed to be the electoral administrator who has been watching lucemon to see if he was worthy of the presidency however once obtaining the sky zones presidential armlet and revealing the corruptive phantom mist to the fusion fighters lucemon uses an incantation to split the sky zone to unleash a shrine containing the phantom mist in order to gain its code crown lucemon than digivolves into his true form of lucemon chaos mode while revealing that he is actually working for laylamon when shoutmon tries to attack lucemon for tricking him and the others he ends up zapped upon the arrival of nene and the mysterious axeknightmon who was promised the phantom mist as part of their partnership telling mikey not to interfere nene releases sparrowmon as they and axeknightmon head to the shrine where the latter has the girl absorb the phantom mist into her fusion loader while traces of it proceed to corrupt the sky zones inhabitants before lucemon takes off having expected the fusion fighters to be unable to fight back with shoutmon wounded he finds himself being attacked by ballistamon and dorulumon before knocking them starmon and the pickmons away when he starts to unleash an attack on mikey it ends up blocked by shoutmon who now sees himself as a better king for having a heart compared to lucemon with beelzemon covering them mikey then forms shoutmon ×4b who defeats lucemon with shakkoumons support with the fusion fighters obtaining the sky zones code crown they are teleported by shakkoumon to the shrine where they find nene harvesting the phantom mists energy before she is grabbed by lucemon though lucemon intends to absorb the phantom mist to become powerful enough to destroy the fusion fighters he ends up being overwhelmed by the dark energy as it consumes him with the fusion fighters and sparrowmon seeing the energy also engulfing nene as well  
as sparrowmon is unable to save nene the phantom mist transforms lucemon into the mindless lucemon shadowlord mode with the girl trapped in the blazing orb gehanna as lucemon takes off sparrowmon attacks him to rescue nene as shoutmon ×4 and beelzemon also get involved in the fight but neither the fusion fighter digimon or sparrowmon the later fast enough to dodge lucemons attacks could stop lucemon as he siphons all the phantom mist from the sky zones darkness-infected citizens growing bigger as a result while a monitamon informs axeknightmon on the current situation while the fusion fighters regroup to figure out how to defeat lucemon they take the unconscious sparrowmon with them leaving beelzemon behind to observe when sparrowmon wakes up in the fusion fighters care she refuses to accept their help saving nene lucemon starts to absorb the sky zone as shoutmon ×4 beelzemon as well as shakkoumon are unable to stop him with axeknightmon refusing to save nene sparrowmon tries another attempt at gehanna with mikey using the patamon digimemory so shoutmon ×4 can support her when sparrowmon manages to penetrate the blazing orb she is grabbed by lucemon just as she almost reaches nene before she is saved by shoutmon ×4 who covers her lucemon then sends shoutmon ×4 and mikey falling after sparrowmon saves nene soon with the mutual assent of both teams mikey manages to digifuse shoutmon ×4 and sparrowmon into shoutmon ×5 to fight lucemon shoutmon ×5 manages to destroy lucemon as the sky zone returns to normal as the fusion fighters are being congratulated by shakkoumon with the code crown given to them taking one of their communication devices out of trust in them sparrowmon meets up with nene as she harvests the faint remains of the phantom mist brought out axeknightmon congratulates nene on fulfilling her mission while telling her that they will go the next zone to recruit its strongest digimon  
while traveling to the next zone mikey expresses concern for nene and axeknightmon a feeling of dread the fusion fighters end up falling from the skies into the jungle zone with angie jeremy cutemon and beelzemon separated from the others as mikey sends dorulumon and deputymon to find them angies group are attacked by stingmon before lilamon arrives to halt him as they bring the group to a sacred temple where the jungle zones guardian resides and can be accessed only by those with love in their hearts as dorulumon and deputymon find their team mates encountering nene and chirstopher on the way the rest of the fusion fighters are under attack by kongoumon and his army of megakabuterimon with shoutmon ×2 knightmon and the pawnchessmon fighting the enemies off before tactimon arrives to turn the tide in his favor while sending kongoumon to the jungle zone shrine to get the code crown luckily dorulumon deputymon and beelzemon appear with the digifused shoutmon ×4b wiping out the megakabuterimon army after tactimon withdraws himself during the battle with the intent of convincing bagramon to unseal his full power back at the shrine after defeating kongoumon christopher has metalgreymon attack stingmon and lilamon to the horror of angie jeremy and cutemon though nene demands christopher have metalgreymon torture them for the means to enter the shrine he refuses on the grounds that he only lives to fight those who are the strongest upon hearing their conversation axeknightmon emerges from nenes fusion loader and attempts to violently convince christopher to reconsider as mikey arrives with shoutmon ×4b to stop him and killing metalgreymon just then the legendary digimon guardian of the temple uses his power to levitate stingmon into his shrine with axeknightmon grabbing nene while in pursuit  
nene and axeknightmon pursue stingmon as he is brought into the temple by the jungle zones protector deckerdramon to be healed outside the temple with mikey bent on saving nene lilamon mentions the dance of true heart ritual which will convince deckerdramon to open the gateway as angie and jeremy are forced to perform the embarrassing dance in front of everyone mikey manages to convince christopher and sparrowmon to help them out once the gateway is opened the main fusion fighter members and christopher enter the temple with sparrowmon and the monitamon following while beelzemon and some of the others stay behind to fight kongoumon and his grankuwagamon army finding axeknightmon as he and nene attempt to enlist the aid of deckerdramon and gain the zones code crown shoutmon ×4 and metalgreymon fight axeknightmon as he has nene split him into skullknightmon and axemon to overwhelm his opponents with teamwork and alternate digifuses mikey tries to reason with nene when she gives the order to reform axeknightmon learning that she is helping him because only he knows the whereabouts of her younger brother hearing christopher telling nene that she needs to be strong deeming the youth to have the most heart of the present company deckerdramon decides to team up with christopher at that time and gives him the code crown following an attack by metalgreymon and deckerdramon nene withdraws to the dust zone with christopher pursuing her after returning to help beelzemon take out kongoumon mikey resolves to help nene but the moment the fusion fighters leave for the dust zone a dark energy entangles mikey as he ends up getting separated from his teammates  
the wave of darkness that mikey is ensnared by while traveling to the dust zone is revealed to be axeknightmons doing as he claims nene is within the remains of the blazing orb but when mikey is unable to touch it due to being pure of heart axeknightmon discards him off a tower with angie saving him by shoving dorulumon in the way soon after the fusion fighters are ambushed by a gang of metalmamemon before mikeys fusion loader is stolen by their leader garbagemon as they and his shadowtoyagumon followers escape with the aid of trailmon kettle during the pursuit mikey shoutmon and dorulumon end up caught between the train tracks as different trailmon pass by discarding trash all around mikeys group then has an encounter with puppetmon a moody resident who reveals that the dust zone is nothing but a garbage dump wasteland ruled by granlocomon whom the discarded residents have to provide mecha to through dishonest methods just to survive when mikeys fusion loader is mentioned puppetmons behavior suddenly changes as he offers to help mikey however once the fusion fighters find the location of garbagemons gang puppetmon steals mikeys fusion loader so he can use it to get granlocomon to give him safe passage out of the zone but granlocomon reveals to have no intent as he proceeds to have the fusion loader installed so he can reach the ideal speed to break into the zone portal with the dust zone demolished in the process luckily with a repentant puppetmons help the fusion fighters regain mikeys fusion loader and shoutmon ×4 destroys granlocomon though it seems the worse is behind the fusion fighters puppetmon and garbagemons group are unexpectedly attacked by axeknightmon with the support of skullgreymon skullsatamon and christopher after he touches the blazing orb  
the fusion fighters are forced to flee from axeknightmon and christopher managing to escape them with puppetmons help through a shaft in a factory soon after upon her arrival laylamon encounters axeknightmon as he makes an offer for an alliance to deal with the fusion fighters laylamon accepts though intending to take the code crown fragments from axeknightmon once their partnership is at an end later that night the fusion fighters are joined by sparrowmon who reveals to mikey that nene is being held in axeknightmons tower and that she is only helping axeknightmon create an item called the darkness loader as he is holding her younger brother captive the next day mikeys group attempts to rescue nene when they are confronted by chirstopher and his forces realizing that christopher is not acting like himself mikey manages to knock christopher out of the blazing orbs influence as their groups join forces to battle the army axeknightmon and lalyamon amassed as shoutmon ×4 metalgreymon deckerdramon and cyberdramon hold their enemies off mikey and sparrowmon reach nene with the former promising her that they will save her brother once nene is saved mikey forms shoutmon ×5 to wipe out the guardromon while using the metalgarurumon digicard that puppetmon provided to take out the tankmon alongside metalgreymon cyber launcher unfortunately axeknightmon reveals the completed darkness loader and uses it to dark fuse skullsatamon and skullgreymon into his weapons to destroy the zone luckily the fusion fighters and blue flare avert the attack as the dust zones code crown appears from the wreckage of darkknightmons tower mikey leaves the code crown fragment to puppetmon while christopher accepts him as a worthy rival before leaving and nene joins the fusion fighters meanwhile as tactimon is livid over the turn of events of their group contending with three other parties for ownership of the digital world bagramon finally decides to get personally involved as he shows up physically in front of tactimon  
after a brief talk with mikey and still needing to find her brother nene discovers that her black fusion loader is no longer working and collapses from fatigue needing to get her some help the team decides to take nene to the monitamons home in the warrior zone however while traveling between the zones the fusion fighters are attacked by the legendary arukadhimon while the others and his fusion loader are sucked into arukadhimons subspace mikey learns the attack was arranged by laylamon to make him suffer as he is thrown to float in digital space however mikey encounters a strange book and meets its occupant wisemon who attemptes to dissect him before convincing the digimon not to mikey soon learns more about the digital world and how the strange events happening in his world are a prelude to what will happen once bagramon has the code crowns he attempts to convince wisemon to help him save his friends however the digimon explains it is illogical forced to go on his own despite wisemon not removing the ball and chain he placed on him mikey reaches arukadhimons subspace as shoutmon and the others barricade themselves in the monsters nest to keep him from eating them luckily sacrificing his book home after a change of heart wisemon saves mikey as he regains his fusion loader and forms shoutmon ×5 so he and the others can make their escape arukadhimon attempts to stop them escaping but is finally destroyed by shoutmon ×5 after mikey uses the darkdramon digicard that jeremy attempted to use earlier as lalyamon arrives and is enraged to find arukadhimon defeated wisemon joins the fusion fighters as they arrive in the warrior zone where they are greeted by a clan of monitamon  
as the fusion fighters meet the monitamon of the warrior zone who have been following their exploits through the monitamon under nene they learn that blastmons general musyamon has taken over most of the warrior zone and is holding the monitamons princess hostage for the code crown just then musyamons right hand shurimon arrives and tries to attack the monitamon elder who has yet to obtain the code crown for the ransom he leaves in exchange for a samurai dvd that will preoccupy musyamon with the monitamon elder guiding them nene joins the quest despite just coming out of her fatigue angie is concerned for her and mikey decides to go after the code crown with the intention of obtaining it to save the monitamons princess on the way to the code crowns current owner karatenmon the fusion fighters are joined by a shady group of etemon who saved jeremy while offering to serve shoutmon once they find him the monitamon elder explains to the fusion fighters that karatenmon will only give up the code crown to whoever can make him laugh everyone puts on their own acts to make him laugh such as shoutmons digifusions with other digimon but with no result however nene who has lightened up a bit more joins angie in a comedy sketch which successfully makes karatenmon laugh when he gives nene the code crown the etemon snatch it while revealing themselves musyamons shadow ninja army mikey digifuses beastmon and ballistamon into ballibeastmon to seduce the etemon before taking them out with a surprise attack while their leader is defeated by shoutmon with the star sword nene and angie become friends as the fusion fighters have the code crown and intend to rescue the princess  
nenes monitamon infiltrate musyamons castle and report that his forces are going to invade the monitamon village to take the code crown by force this places the fusion fighters in a situation as they need to protect the village rather than save the princess as they planned wanting to impress nene jeremy offers to sneak into musyamons castle with the rare star sword and a group consisting of dorulumon and a trio of red monitamon at first due to the red monitamons lack of skills jeremy starts to see that he is in way over his head but when he sees the rest of the fusion fighters doing their best of hold off shurimons army he is more determined to sneak into the castle while dorulumon holds off the guards jeremy then faces off against musyamon with the red monitamon aiding him while nenes monitamon save the princess when jeremys words and situation are broadcast to the rest nene flies over to the base to save the red monitamon from musyamon in the process nenes fusion loader assumes a lavender color as she digifuses the red monitamon into hi-vision monitamon who knocks musyamon out of the castle from there the fusion fighters regroup and mikey forms shoutmon ×5 to defeat musyamon and his forces with hi-vision monitamons support afterwards advising him to let the red monitamon join his group so they can be in touch nene gives mikey the warrior zone code crown while explaining that she will be a full-time member once she finds her brother eventually the fusion fighters have a meeting with the princess as she turns out to be a babamon who has fallen in love with a shocked jeremy  
the fusion fighters arrive to the disc zone to find christopher who won its code crown from mercurymon is leading his forces against blastmon but as the fight between deckergreymon and blastmon is causing the zone to break apart mikey tries to stop the battle with shoutmon ×4k but things worsen as shoutmon is unable to sustain his digi-fused state and is separated from the others alongside greymon and mailbirdramon when the ground begins to collapse under them and blastmon as shoutmon helps greymon and mailbirdramon while dealing with what they said about his inability to maintain his digi-fused state mikey tries and fails to persuade christopher to save the zone but christopher reveals his intentions to make the digital world a place for only the strong showing no concern for his lost digimon at that time blastmon calls in bulbmon to deal with the two generals before shoutmon greymon and mailbirdramon appear convincing christopher to let him handle this to lessen the damage on the zone mikey forms shoutmon ×4k but shoutmon starts to losing the digi fusion as bulbmon attempts to crush the weakened digimon luckily feeling he needs o repay shoutmon for saving him greymon unexpectedly steps in to assist shoutmon ×4k in getting bulbmon in midair for the former to destroy him but the victory is short lived as the disc zone starts to collapse with christopher despite mikeys insistence that the strong can coexist with the weak leaving the fusion fighters stuck in the center of the rapidly disintegrating disc zone  
seeing that the collapsing disc zone is beyond saving mikey quickly transfers all the digimon over to the warrior zone there becoming friends with disc zone resident lunamon shoutmon begins to still have doubts over his both his resolve and ability to maintain his digi-fused state later that night wisemon reveals to mikey that fragments of blastmon cling onto some of them and have formed a armorless replica of the real blastmon with beelzemon providing back-up after being digi-fused with deputymon shoutmon ×4 shatters the replica with the monitamon destroying the shards so they would not form new replicas that would pinpoint the fusion fighters location to the real blastmon eventually realizing their friends strange behavior mikey and the others find shoutmon getting some personal training from ballistamon and beelzemon to get stronger by morning a mysterious digimon appears to help shoutmon finish his training while informing him that blastmon will be arriving soon as blastmon arrives shoutmon ×4b fights against him while affirming his intention to become the digimon king by becoming strong to protect those weaker than himself as blastmon takes to the air to have an advantage nene arrives with shoutmon ×4b digifusing with sparrowmon to defeat blastmon as shoutmon ×5b soon after like with shoutmon mikey begins to hear the hears the melody of another digimon close to dying elsewhere as the bodiless blastmon is chided by tactimon for losing 21 of his code crowns to the fusion fighters the mysterious digimon known as tuwarmon is revealed to be darkknightmons spy within the bagra army under the guise of damemon  
following the digimelody mikey finds and rescues the digimon named spadamon once healed by cutemon spadamon explains that he has been searching for the fusion fighters spadamon explains further the sweet zone has been taken over by the bagra armys matadormon who has forced the zones patissiere chefs to prepare desserts for him once at the sweet zone with angie expressing her to be an expert at desserts while spadamon revealing that matadormon only appears before chefs mikey persuades a group on monzaemon guards that angie is the best patissiere in the digital world while nene and the monitamon concentrate on rescuing the imprisoned chefs the fusion fighters enter a kitchen colosseum where angie is to engage the top chef warumonzaemon matadormons private chef in a iron chef contest where the loser is sent to the dungeon while angie confides that she is not good as baking she does remember the recipe for banana cream pie as the fusion fighters offer to help her out however warumonzaemon tricks shoutmon and ballistamon into eating the bananas while hoarding all the fruit this forces angie to use sweet potatoes as a substitute with the fusion fighters barely getting their cake ready in time to be judged by matadormon who reveals himself after deeming their unappealing sweet potato cake to have an excellent taste but once mikey learns that nene freed the chefs the fusion fighters reveal themselves with warumonzaemon absorbs the monzaemon to become giga warumonzaemon who overpowers shoutmon ×4 but spadamon offers himself to the fusion fighters transformed into a secondary weapon for the newly formed shoutmon ×4s who defeats giga warumonzaemon later cutemon learns from coronamon one of the freed chefs that cutemons parents were sent to the underground along with other residents matadormon then suddenly appears and splits the ground with a drop kick sending the fusion fighters falling  
the fusion fighters find themselves into the sweets zones underground and with cutemon sensing his parents nearby mikey and others attempt to search for them and the zone residents before finding themselves surrounded by raremon luckily the group evades the raremon by splitting up after the montiamon use smoke bombs to cover their escape with jeremy and nene learning the raremon are the prisoners transformed after their data is extracted mikey learns the data is being transferred into an ancient machine digimon that spadamon explains to be the legendary breakdramon once everyone regroups shoutmon ×5 is then formed to fight breakdramon before matadormon appears and reveals cutemons parents as hostages while using their power to undo the damage on breakdramon before proceeding to nearly kill shoutmon ×5 though cutemon wants to save his parents their telepathic request to help his friends prompts cutemon to heal shoutmon ×5 mikey and spadamon use this time to save cutemons parents with the star sword before shoutmon ×5 proceeds to take out matadormon with breakdramons destruction restoring the sweet zone residents to their original states a while after the fusion fighters obtain the core crown cutemon says goodbye to his parents as he continues to travel with the fusion fighters into the next zone  
 
the fusion fighters arrived to sword zone where its resident digimon strive to become 
great swordsmen before the zone fall under attack by grademon though shoutmon ×4 managed to defeat grademon mikey feels bad for their opponent as his wish that grademon was good comes true after he obtains the sword zone code crown grademon leaves the place his intent for a rematch reminding jeremy of his own issue with mikey before christopher appears in front of mikey and reveals that all code crowns have been founded and all code crown possessors are notified that a war for the digital world will soon begin tactimon soon appears and establishes a barrier to keep the two groups from escaping with the intent to obtain their code crowns with his sword of storms unsealed tactimon overwhelms shoutmon ×5 and deckergreymon before taking code crowns from mikeys and christophers fusion loaders to present to bagramon when tactimon about to demolish mikey when the boy stands up to him grademon returns to save the human before sacrificing himself by destroy tactimons tower so beelzemon can enter the zone shoutmon ×5b is then formed to send tactimon off the zone with the help of greymon and other fusion fighter digimon however using his crystal ball as a medium bagramon uses his power to absorb all of the code crowns and send mikey angie and jeremy back to the human world together with shoutmon now the ruler of the digital world bagramon is revealed to be axeknightmons elder brother as they plan on making big changes with mikey removed from the picture  
ending up back in their world with shoutmon invisible to all but them mikey angie and jeremy learn that their time in the digital world was about half a day in their reality with no one believing them mikey later hears the voice who had granted him the fusion loader though is unable to find it the next day mikey meets up with angie and jeremy telling them his intention to go back to the digital world and save their friends over there the voice eventually responds to his words with mikey following it the alley where he and his friends first entered the digital world the voice revealed to be the digicard of omnimon after fully materialising shoutmon and explaining the origin of the digicard omnimon reveals he can use what power he has remaining to return mikey and shoutmon to the digital world but angie and jeremy must stay behind just then tactimon who was trapped in the real world attacks the city as he uses the electricity to enlarge while fully bioemerging tactimon proceeds to chase after mikey defeating the darkdramon digicard before taking angie and jeremy hostage to force the boy to hand over the fusion loader however angie and jeremys passionate emotions becomes energy that enters mikeys fusion loader allowing shoutmon to digivolve into omnishoutmon who manages to destroy tactimon soon after mikey and shoutmon returns to the digital world with angie and jeremy holding on to the powerless omnimon digicard while promising to join their team once able to at the bagra armys reformatted base bagra pandemonium nenes brother ewan learns of mikeys return as he expresses joy to axeknightmon that he will get to fight the youth

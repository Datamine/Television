as the duel between kenshin and aoshi continues kenshin is being attacked by aoshi trying to scold him for who he ought to be kenshin is determined to return aoshi to an affectionate man allowing him to bring aoshi back misao thus attempting keep both promises he made to each of them aoshi finally realizes his wrongdoings as kenshin and aoishi ends the match using their final attacks on each other after emerging victorious kenshin and sanosuke advance to the next battle  
kaoru yahiko and misao are to battle against kamatari honjō henya kariwa and iwanbō yahiko manages to defeat henya after being almost killed by his hikku happa attack after that kamatari kaoru and misao fight misao gets crushed ribs in the fight against kamatari and is unable to continue until she wakes up from a dream of hannya and she and kaoru defeat kamatari through a combined effort it seems like they have won until two other members of the ten swords elder saizuchi and fuji appear which in turn puts kaoru yahiko and misao at a major disadvantage  
just when all hope seems lost seijuro shows up and fights fuji he talks to fuji and make him realize that he was being used and asks for a fair fight he defeats fuji with the kuzu-ryūsen attack the inn is safe from harm but kenshin still has to fight sojiro in order to fight shishio himself  
kenshin and sojiro have their second duel since the one in shingetsu village was never finished sojiro shows kenshin his shukuchi technique one that uses powerful legwork to bring him close to his opponent in an instant kenshin manages to get himself pretty wounded in the fight and sojiro hasnt even gotten hit once he even dodges the kuzu-ryūsen attack ironically supposed to be an inescapable attack sojiro recalls about kenshin showing mercy to senkaku during their battle at shingetsu village which poses as a distraction to sojiro this then urges sojiro to take an intermission from the battle after breaking the strap of one of his shoes  
it is shown that sojiro was treated as a servant to his family one that never showed him respect or affection he later meets shishio who kindly spared his life after learning how cruel sojiros family is to him shishio offers him the wakizashi sword when sojiro is soon cornered by his family he uses the sword to murder them all sojiro follows shishio as shishio tells sojiro that he will become strong  
after pondering between the philosophies of shishios survival of the strong and kenshins protection of the weak sojiro becomes heavily confused suddenly breaking down during the fight sojiro and kenshin fight each other and full strength the shuntensatsu attack versus the amakakeru ryū no hirameki attack after kenshin is claimed the winner he and sanosuke make their way to the final battle with shishio sojiro tells yumi of a secret passageway to get to shishios room first he also reveals the secret of kenshins ultimate attack in that kenshin takes an extra step in his stance sojiro then requests yumi to return the wakizashi sword back to shishio as a parting gift to leave his side forever  
yumi guides kenshin and sanosuke to the top of the inferno arena kenshin thinks about his past and what awaits him next the entire way up to where shishio himself is waiting with hōji at his side shishio promises that the battle will end in fifteen minutes giving yumi a kiss as he walks off thus the fight between the two manslayers begins shishio shows off the homura dama attack the first of his secret sword technique he then bites a chunk off of kenshins shoulder  
shishio doesnt believe that kenshin understands the laws of nature philosophizes about the survival of the fittest through chaos and not just a worthless mirage of peace shishio then uses the guren kaina attack the second of his secret sword technique giving kenshin a concussion saito suddenly busts through the door using his gatotsu first stance executing the ishiki attack however shishio is protected by a metal plate in his forehead after trying the rest of his gatotsu stances saito soon gets knocked out by shishio even sanosuke attempts to attack shishio but to no avail it is then that aoshi appears to engage in combat with shishio  
aoshi struggles to defeat shishio even after landing the kaiten kenbu rokuren attack after much time passes by kenshin regains consciousness due to his swordsman spirit surviving the painful injuries inflicted by shishio just when shishio is about to finish kenshin off with another guren kaina attack kenshin remembers the promise he made to kaoru to go back to tokyo together kenshin is able to initiate the kuzu-ryūsen attack of the hiten mitsurugi-ryū injuring shishio nonetheless shishio gets back up because of his swordsman spirit despite his injuries and fatigue kenshin prepares his final attack the battōjutsu amakakeru ryū no hirameki  
shishio gets ready to use the kaguzuchi attack the final of his secret sword technique to counter kenshins move this result in a void between the two attacks which temporarily immobilized shishio enabling kenshin to strike shishio with an immensely strong consecutive hit even after miraculously standing back up shishios blood starts evaporating and he begins screaming in pain since he has fought far longer than fifteen minutes however shishio sets his sights on kenshin and yumi impaling them both even after yumi tries to stop kenshin from killing shishio yumi dies happily knowing she did something useful for once as the battle continues the battle is once again at a standstill however shishio is killed by spontaneous combustion hōji refusing to accept shishios defeat maniacally attempts to destroy the inferno arena to kill kenshin sanosuke saito and aoshi  
sanosuke and aoshi drag kenshin out of the building eventually escaping the eruption saito is left behind due to his overly injured legs not being able to jump the collapsed bridge the inferno arena finally demolishes seemingly killing saito kenshin sanosuke and aoshi regroup with kaoru yahiko and misao chō also appears to tell the group the aftermath of the ten swords meanwhile shishio yumi and hōji gather in the underworld and plot an ambush  
yahiko visits mount hiei and sanosuke shows him where that battle with shishio took place meanwhile kenshin visits an unknown womans grave and places flowers by it also at this time megumi explains to kaoru the severity of kenshins wounds and that it is important to keep him from doing anything that dangerous again finally the group gets on the train to tokyo with misao waving to them and telling them to visit again after the train departs saito is seen saying that he and kenshin will meet again one day and settle the score that they have when the gang reaches the road to the dojo kaoru extends her hand and welcomes kenshin home  


kenshin himura goes off fishing to bring some food on the table at the river he meets an old man who tells him the legend of the fireflies at the end it is revealed the old man was telling kenshin the tragic story of his dead lover who died waiting for him to return from his long quest to master the sword he gives kenshin the message that once in his life every man meets a woman he will never forget after hearing his story kenshin brings back an iris flower which he does not give to kaoru kamiya  
a foreign prince is attacked by bandits as kenshin and kaoru are returning from a play they see this and kenshin intervenes during the attack the prince was injured so kenshin and kaoru take them back to the dojo as it turns out the prince looks exactly like yahiko myojin and so yahiko is put in his place to attend a banquet at the banquet the bandits attack yet again but kenshin is there to protect yahiko along with sanosuke sagara  
when he finds himself under attack by a gang of masked men deemed the kenwadan a politician throws the key to his safe into an alleyway the kenwadan frantically tries to pursue a dog that had promptly picked up the key and the chase continues into a river sanosuke comes across the same dog the next morning while praying at the shrine for better luck at dice carrying it back to the dojo in the care of megumi takani the dog which sanosuke names notaro promptly tears the lives of the protagonists apart eating their food stealing and burying their possessions and generally making a nuisance of himself unfortunately since sanosuke distributes flyers indicating a found dog it does not take the kenwadan long to track notaro down while kenshin and yahiko is informed by the police about the situation involving the kenwadan sanosuke encounters and defeats the kenwadan in a nearby forest  
kaoru starts faintly daydreaming about being married to kenshin on tanabata after tae sekihara explains what an engagement ring symbolizes kenshin is distracted with going fishing coming back with a catfish kenshin takes a bite of his share of catfish and finds an engagement ring inside tae convinces kenshin into giving kaoru the ring in which kenshin is unbeknownst to what it symbolizes during the time sanosuke goes fishing he sees a man about to commit suicide coincidentally finding out that the engagement ring originally belonged to the man who threw it away when he thought his girlfriend was seeing someone else sanosuke gets kenshin and yahiko to work out a way to get the ring without hurting kaorus feelings the three confess to her concerning the situation after temporarily intoxicating her the ring is given back to the man in order for him to be engaged to his fiancée  
misao makimachi reports to the group concerning a murder mystery in kyoto as it is witnessed that strange carvings are engraved on the back of a corpse of a politician aoshi shinomori is approached by another politician seeking protection from a written death threat only to refuse his request misao sends this letter to okina who deduces that it is written in either portuguese or dutch and the symbol on the bottom of the letter resembles much of the carvings on the corpse the assassin ultimately kills the politician and puts misao in a comatose state the group goes to kyoto finding out that the assassin practices the hiten mitsurugi-ryū battōjutsu kenshin visits seijuro hiko who reveals that the assassin is a christian swordsman named shōgo amakusa one who is capable of defeating the kuzu-ryūsen attack  
shōgo appears to where chō sawagejō is protecting yet another politician he easily defeats chō and flawlessly kills the politician when the groups goes to visit chō in a hospital it is confirmed that shōgo surpasses kenshin in skill okina finds out that the three men killed were responsible for persecuting christians during the edo dynasty sanosuke enters a cavern behind a waterfall and finds a christian occult gathered in front of shōgos younger sister lady magdalia and her childhood friend shōzo sanosuke follows the two outside and later assaults a band of police officers who were after a medallion in their possession an agitated shōzo manages to cause sanosuke to delve into the waterfall however soon losing hold of the medallion kenshin learns about how shōgo betrayed his uncle to seek revenge for the befallen christians  
as the group explore shimabara they are introduced to an ambassador named sir elsten who is acquainted with kenshin for saving his life a decade ago at the end of the edo dynasty sir elsten urges to be contacted if a potential riot occurs shōgo is unaware that sanosuke has the medallion as he and lady magdalia are traveling toward shimabara with a crowd of christians gathered near shōgo proves to them that he is deemed the child of god by performing miracles kaoru tells yahiko that she feels pity for the persecuted christians the two notice that a group of christian children dropped a medallion after being seen kaoru later enters a house outside a cave only to find out the location of a cathedral meanwhile kenshin and sanosuke are in another part of the cave being surrounded by a herd of dogs led by a round man with a dog whistle  
the round man accidentally breaks his dog whistle when kenshin fights back losing control of the dogs so in turn kenshin ends up saving himself and the round man from the dogs the round man is confused since he was told that kenshin is a demon and has to be killed the round man chains kenshin to a tree and goes for lady magdalia to see what he should do with kenshin kaoru confronts shōgo concerning his purpose having kenshin dead kenshin broken free of the chains remains at the tree as kaoru shōgo lady magdalia and the round man comes to see him shōgo battles against kenshin to prove of his superior strength and speed kenshin chooses to execute the kuzu-ryūsen attack instead of the amakakeru ryū no hirameki attack showing mercy upon shōgo however shōgo strikes kenshin with blindness as he falls over a cliff into the waters below  
sanosuke has fallen off a crevice inside the cave and sees lady magdalia she patches up his bruises back at her home in the hill the two later have an argument about shōgo sanosuke reveals that he has lost the medallion lady magdalia locks him inside the room meanwhile shōgo plots with kaiou and santo two of his followers the demise of the meiji government through the instigation of a civil war but they are disagreeing over price and methodology lady magdalia carries a gun and returns to the room where she locked sanosuke but he has disappeared locate the lost medallion shōzo interrupts sanosukes search for the medallion and engages in combat both of them are weakened by each others attacks kaiou and santo are given lady magdalias lost medallion  
misao tells kenshin kaoru and yahiko about the secret between shōgo and lady magdalia shōgo was once able to help cure numerous due to his study under the field of medicine however he is unable to cure his dying younger sister when the two were younger their parents were killed one after another by nonbelievers kenshin kaoru yahiko and misao sees that santo is signalling the formation of an army from his boat lady magdalia is informed that kaiou has her medallion alerting her to search for it in his room she later realizes that kaiou plans to betray shōgo and her sanosuke and shōzo show up trying to stop kaiou only to allow the three of them to be locked into the cage as an avalanche of boulders plummet over them  
kenshin is caught in a noose by one of kaious underlings yet kenshin is quickly able to defeat him meanwhile shōzo is left buried under a boulder and it is up to sanosuke and lady magdalia to help free him to allow him to report this incident to shōgo sanosuke is to fight another one of kaious underlings and sanosuke is easily able to knock him unconscious however lady magdalia has hyperventilated due to her illness kenshin kaoru yahiko and misao arrives accompany the two out of the cave after kenshin figures out that lady magdalia has tuberculosis sanosuke scurries over to find sir elsten for him to treat lady magdalia and for him to know about the formation of the army shōzo later overhears what kaiou is plotting trying to fight him but was defeated and as a last resort shōzo threw some pipe bombs given by sanosuke thereby killing kaiou  
the army has prepared themselves to fight shōgo and his christian martyrs sanosuke continued to try and bring lady magdalia to sir elsten after achieving many obstacles sanosuke manages to luckily encounter sir elsten with santo however santo attempts to shoot sir elsten for interfering with kaious goals in which lady magdalia jumps in and takes the bullet sanosuke pummels santo to the ground and returns lady magdalias medallion back to her thereafter of which she passes away sir elsten hurries to get to the holy hill to stop the war meanwhile kenshin finally arrives and tries to stop the fight finding shōgo there and tells him he will be fought if the children would be forced to sacrifice themselves  
sir elsten arrives to the military base to stop the attack when misao was there saying that kenshin is negotiating with shōgo kenshin would be given one hour to convince shōgo to surrender before the military becomes involved misao informs sir elsten that she will send a smoke signal at the peak of the holy hill indicating a successful negotiation as the duel begins kenshin empathizes with shōgo understanding how he feels they both eventually use the amakakeru ryū no hirameki attack in which shōgo is defeated in the end kenshin regains his sight and misao sends the smoke signal ending the war and announcing shōgos surrender  
kenshin visits sir elsten to find out what will happen to the believers and so on sir elsten is waiting for the decision of the government should it arrive shortly an official arrives and tells them that the believers can no longer stay in japan this enlightens a thankful sir elsten deciding that the believers can come to holland meanwhile sanosuke gives kaoru a letter and a package concealing lady magdalias medallion and she goes to see shōgo for a brief period sanosuke goes to lady magdalias tombstone and reminisces of his time with her an angry shōzo appears to sanosuke disappointed having lost lady magdalia he explains how he feels guilty for taking kaious life shōgo later goes to the tombstone reading the letter that lady magdalia wrote as he makes his way toward holland  
while the group are eating at a restaurant a gang called the tengu creates a disturbance in which yahiko and misao take them outside and fight them then a man claiming to be the legendary manslayer arrives and scares them away the group is concerned about lodging since there is no room left they reluctantly make their way up to the temple of the impostor and notices that there is a dojo managed there the group unwillingly helps out the impostor therefore having a place to stay the tengu group is getting restless and hires a swordsman to kill the fake battousai the swordsman arrives at the dojo demanding to fight the fake battousai kenshin comes back from shopping and saves the impostor by defeating the swordsman kenshin later allows him to keep the name of the legendary manslayer and the group sets sail to go back home  
the group walks through the forest and ends up eating at a resort however kenshin realizes he has lost kaorus travelling money unable to pay the check the group offers to work off the money later that night kaoru and misao go into the hot springs but they spot an artist and mistake him for a voyeur they realize he is an artist seeking inspiration and the artist begs kaoru to be his model for his next painting due to her beauty unaware that she is already in love with kenshin the artist falls in love with kaoru misao and sanosuke tell the artist that if he can hit kenshin sanosuke will try to bring the artist and kaoru together no matter how hard the artist tries he cannot hit kenshin after seeing that kaorus love for kenshin is the source of the beauty the artist gets his inspiration and draws a portrait of kaoru as kaoru shows the others the drawing they run away in laughter due to the drawings abstract nature  
a man named daigoro is talking about people being able to go to the moon but he receives sarcastic remarks from others as he leaves with his teacher named kaishu katsu the two are soon ambushed by unknown assassins the group manages to protect them until another student named tetsuma appears and frightens them away kaishu exiles daigoro from the katsu dojo due to poor swordsmanship in which kaoru vows to teach him the skills and techniques of the sword kaishus daughter named itsuko as well as tetsuma goes to the kamita dojo trying to bring daigoro back daigoro refuses to leave and itsuko later decides to reside at the dojo kenshin leaves to tell kaishu that his daughter is staying at the kamiya dojo  
when kenshin prepares to depart the group of assassins return revealing themselves as the beni aoi of which kenshin has no knowledge of their group he comes back to the kamiya dojo to tell the others that daigoro and itsuko can continue to stay although it is hinted that kaishu misses both of them it is revealed that kaishu was accused of giving financial aid to an army for a war during the edo period itsuko goes out to buy some ingredients for the dinner recipe yet kaoru causes the dinner to inflame the beni aoi follows itsuko and kidnaps her kenshin later finds itsukos hairpin on the ground outside and kaishu receives a letter stating the abduction  
kenshin pays kaishu a visit finding out that he was hiding a sum of money from the government and that the beni aoi is in search of it kaishu is informed to arrive at a temple late at night and his daughter will not be harmed if he chooses to cooperate kenshin was told not to come but he involves everyone else including daigoro they arrived at the temple before kaishu daigoro sees itsuko as he sees her attempting to escape but trips to the ground daigoro charged forward and was stabbed  
after daigoro was just stabbed kenshin steps forward to fight the leader while the others take care of the rest the leader is defeated and shortly the police arrives and arrests the beni aoi kaishu catches tetsuma red-handed for searching for a map to the hidden money tetsuma tries to reason with kaishu only to resort to violence kenshin intervenes and fights tetsuma sword to sword however a desperate tetsuma then uses a gun daigoro manages to convince him to cease of his wrongdoings in which tetsuma turns himself in for repentance  
yutaro tsukayama returns to the dojo with professor hans having a reunion with the group meanwhile the black knights are after professor hans and want something from him the group goes to the akabeko to celebrate yutaros return kenshin stays behind after everyone else leaves the black knights attack professor hans taking a map from his possession they retreat soon after kenshin steps in to fight while he was brought back to be treated professor hans tells yutaro that he has left his notebook and a rock under the porch of the dojo as a clue of the whereabouts of a divine elixir

while the group travels through the forest yahiko becomes dehydrated a hunter passes by and brought yahiko into his dwelling to treat him with herbal tea the hunter tells the group that the divine elixir may be found at a lake deep into the mountains after the lake parts the group finally figures out that the divine elixir is hidden inside a dark cave on the other side of a crossing they encounter many obstacles within the cave yutaro uses the rock to place on an altar igniting the cave however misanagi the leader of the sanada ninjas appears and tells the group that the pathway will lead to the bottom of the abyss in which the floor collapses as they descend toward the base of the cave  
misanagi and the black knights enter the pathway and begin to move toward the divine elixir meanwhile the group is surround by sulfur and phosphorus at the bottom of the abyss sanosuke must punch through the wall to force a current of water to flow through allowing the group to escape outside the cave they find kaita one of the sanada ninjas who is severe injured yutaro is able to treat his wounds kaita later helps by showing them a tunnel that will lead them back to the pathway inside the cave the group is soon interfered by zan and ren two of the elite members of the sanada ninjas

the wind and water clans of feng shui compete surrounding a shrine initially creating a pentagram barrier around the land circa 1602 after 275 years this magic begins to reactivate and cause disasters in the tokyo prefecture after each of these incidents a man named reisui claiming to be a water feng shui master appears to provide advice to the victims however as soon as the man leaves a mysterious entrepreneur named saeke turns up to offer his services such as warding stones inscribed with the power of feng shui when the akabeko catches fire from one of its stoves tae and tsubame are to lodge at the kamiya dojo saeke takes a visit there only to be pardoned by tae the group is soon attacked by feng shui fledglings in which the wind feng shui master named jinpu arrives to save them  
jinpu explains to the group regarding the history between the two clans of feng shui a map is shown that while the wind clan had set up an eigou formation that would protect the town the water clan will set up one that would destroy it the water clan will construct railroad tracks to the five locations of the warding stones disguised as their eigou formation reisui later attacks the dojo but later retreats after jinpu retaliates  
kaoru is severely wounded from reisuis attacks jinpu informs that she will be cured after obtaining natural spring water from musashino kenshin and jinpu head to musashino to collect the water sanosuke along with tsunan tsukioka are to seek and destroy the relics of the shisa and yahiko needs to stay behind to protect kaoru meanwhile the water clan is slowly destroying the wind eigou formation kenshin and jinpu finally make it into a cave the mountains while dodging various obstacles of feng shui kenshin is able to collect the water and safely escorts jinpu out of the cave before it collapses the ryu myaku starts to move east of musashino toward nikko to follow the path of the eigou formation  
kaoru has recovered from the spring water given by kenshin and jinpu the two must leave for nikko to find the jade crest hidden in the area before the ryu myaku gets there first sanosuke and tsunan find a book that gave many useful clues but in a difficult language they find the author to explain its contexts clues and hints were being pieced together and the plans of the water clan started to become clearer kenshin and jinpu arrive at nikko only to find out that reisui has the jade crest reisui traps the two in a feng shui illusion but they manage to overcome it sanosuke finds kenshin and jinpu and explains that the ryu myaku has changed their direction toward senjogahara  
kenshin sanosuke and jinpu go to senjogahara encountering the water clan jinpu attacks reisui but the former has proven to be weaker than that of the latter meanwhile the author arrives and tells tsunan to put the dragon statue in the center of the shrine hoping it will stop the ryu myaku jinpu is able to halt and defeat the water clan after reisui sacrifices himself saeke reveals that it was he that possesses the jade crest yet he is shortly defeated thereafter and the jade crest was taken from him by jinpu it is then that jinpu who directs the ryu myaku toward the shrine of which colliding with the dragon statue weakens and stops its feng shui the police department slowly rebuild their stations and kenshin bids jinpu a final farewell

marty and benny have a trading idea but cannot execute it due to the firms low capital position sally visits the trading floor later to assure the skeletal staff that the firm will not go under when marty ridicules her she demands that he hire a foreign exchange trader by the following day marty convinces chris to return 
while a financial tv show announces that adam made 12 million speculating on the large banks stock sally suggests that the judges dislike for jack might have been prearranged as if someone might have influenced the choice of judge to hear jacks case adam tells her he actually made 15 million on the trade and shows surprise when he hears that david astin was in the court 
in jail jack is harassed by another inmate he soon gets into his first fight 
adam goes on a date with a woman who has close ties to a high-level government person who might be able to help recapitalized the firm if it can buy the debt of an airline name algonquin air expecting that he will be charged with assault and be barred from working in the securities industry as a result adam prepares to give jacks office away adam offers ian farnham a job but he initially refuses when he tells ian that they have an airline debt issue in the works and suggests that he will get more experience from the ten-day deal than in 10 years of working in his current position ian becomes more interested after adam assures him that he is not making the offer as a favor to ians mother ian becomes even more amenable 
sally and grant later visit him in jail but jack is unwilling to help her find a way to re-capitalize and suggests she asks donald for help when grant sees a woman who was talking to the inmate who beat jack up crying he offers her a handkerchief later grant suggest to cathy that they try to get jack out of jail but she refuses to help while in jail jack suspects that there is a conspiracy against him he decides to plead guilty 
when benny overhears marty making job interview arrangements he points out that the firm cannot survive without marty grant asks ann to help her get jack out of jail the two of them meet the inmate who beat up jack along with the inmates lawyer to offer his wife a forgivable loan if he protects jack for the remainder of his time in jail 
benny tells sally of the days events on the trading floor and also informs her that marty has a dinner interview realizing that the firm has to do a deal in order to re-capitalize she changes her mind on the algonquin air deal in order to persuade marty to sell algonquin stock she decides to offer him more money and a seat on the executive committee 
behind adams back sally approaches ians mother and promises to underwrite algonquin if ians mother will be transparent about what gardner will get in return for the deal later donalds analysis concludes that the only way to structure the algonquin issue would be to use a high-yield convertible bond while the two of them are working adam interrupts them to confront sally over her communication with ians mother he tells sally that in return for algonquin gardner ross will be the new fiscal agent for the maritime provinces an arrangement that should bring in about 50 million per year he then informs sally that he has hired ian to replace jack while hes in jail 
jacks adversary inmate warns him to stay away later the inmate confronts jack but runs away when jack doesnt back down before leaving prison he tells jack about the offer that ann and grant gave him 
after looking at the preliminary algonquin prospectus marty tells sally that he could sell it but refuses to do so because he considers it beneath him when donald points out that its on him to keep the firm together with jack gone he relents later marty tells the other members of the firm that while he could sell the bond it would kill its reputation ian advises him to make the issue sound overly complex and convince more junior salespeople that its a sure bet but marty still does not agree to sell it adam and sally offer to make him a principal of the firm and member of the executive committee if he sells it the issue does not go as well as hoped gardner has to subscribe to a half of it 
in court later jack pleads not guilty 
at the end of the episode it is revealed that adam and ians mother are intimate and that he has hired ian as a favor to his mother
